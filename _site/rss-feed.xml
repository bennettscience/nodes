					<description>&lt;p&gt;Adding to the list of things to blog so I don’t forget about them in the future, I built an event manager web app for prom.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reclaiming Jekyll</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;In December, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ohheybrian.com/2018/01/move-wordpress-to-jekyll-complete-guide.html&quot;&gt;I moved off of WordPress to Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. This is easy to do with GitHub Pages, but I wanted to self-host because keeping a SSL certificate was important to me. I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.timowens.io/running-a-jekyll-site-on-reclaim-hosting/&quot;&gt;Tim Owen’s sample&lt;/a&gt; had everything up and working well.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dynamic Data Validation with Apps Script</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;My coworker, Kat, needed to set up meetings with our 13 elementary schools. Appointment slots would have been a lot of clicking back and forth on calendar events plus her dates were variable and subject to change. She set up a spreadsheet with each school on a row. The challenge was to set up data validation rules that would automatically update after a school made a selection.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Planning a Flipped Unit Part 4</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Now it’s down to the &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; of your unit. Standards have been identified and selected, themes established, and your main mechanism for assessment has been designed to check what students know and can do at the conclusion of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Will Hide Ads in Exchange for Bitcoin</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Several articles swirled around early this week about Salon.com’s (sorry, not going to link it) new ad-blocking choice to users. You can:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Planning a Flipped Unit Part 3</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Once you know why you’re teaching what you’re teaching, you need to define how you’ll know what students have learned or not learned. What task(s) will students complete in order to show what they’ve learned as you move through the unit? Keep in mind that this does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; necessarily have to be a written test! This step in planning helps you meaningfully outline the &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; of your unit.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Rebooting My Coaching</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I planned, and ran, a really unsuccessful series of PD for a group of teachers this year. Unfortunately, I wasn’t wise enough to accept the non-success until we’d reached almost a breaking point in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Planning a Flipped Unit Part 2</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest portion of the circle, the &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt;, defines &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; you do in the unit. Before planning a single activity (or lesson), it is important to take time to outline what the students will be learning within the unit as a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Planning a Flipped Unit</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea for this series was sparked when I was helping some people research sample flipped lessons for a curriculum workshop I was facilitating. I was embarrassed while working with this teacher because most of what we found was significantly below standard.&lt;/p&gt;
