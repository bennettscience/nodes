As I was walking back to my classroom this afternoon, I passed a couple of learners in the hall talking about their grades. I don’t have either of these individuals in my class, nor do I know what class they were discussing, but that is beside the point.

What stuck in my head is when the girl said, “... <a href="/2011/10/grades/">Read more</a>

    As some of my followers noticed near the end of last week, I had a moment of weakness after my toughest class. I’ve been very frustrated with having to micromanage their learning using a flipped model, and it really has made me think hard. Long story short, I’m not giving up on a flipped class or a standards-based model, but I do need to make so... <a href="/2011/10/learning-about-motivation/">Read more</a>

    I’ve been struggling to find time to write recently. This has been a good and a bad thing. For one, I’m busy with learners during the day and I’m spending more time planning new activities and recording new and updated podcasts. I’m also doing multiple presentations this month and next, so I’ve been working on planning for those as well.

    I borrowed an idea from John Spencer about using a photo writing prompt to get some creative juices flowing in learners. There is a Tumblr page that has a collection of writing prompts to help start that process. Tumblr is blocked, so I hopped on to compfight.com and searched the word “quiet.”

I got this image. I put it up, gave some brief inst... <a href="/2011/09/who-says-you-cant-teach-writing-in-science/">Read more</a>

    Here is what I’m look at for the middle steps of The Ladder I’m trying to build up for my learners. You can read Part 1 here.

Obviously, before we begin these steps (3 and 4), we’ve given them the learning objectives for the chapter we’re moving to and they’ve taken some form of pre-assessment that will give learners the information they need t... <a href="/2011/09/adapting-for-learning-planning-and-implementation/">Read more</a>

    It’s been a week since I’ve written. That is both good and bad…I got a lot more work done this week, but now I have about 1000 ideas flying through my brain, and I have to organize some of them in order to keep functioning. This is my grandest idea out of all of them, and it will be a short series on how I think it will flesh out once I try it o... <a href="/2011/09/adapting-for-learning-the-ladder/">Read more</a>

    This morning I’ve been reflecting on the last year of teaching and what growth I’ve had and what growth I still need to accomplish.

My first attempt at blogging was called Mastering Chemistry and I tried to reason out what it meant to build chemistry students. I wrote mainly about my classes and the blog was usually a space for me to post overf... <a href="/2011/09/educator-learner/">Read more</a>

    I missed the first half of the Republican debate last night due to a soccer game. I caught the second half, and was a little frustrated that Brian and John focused so much on the four popular candidates, but that’s neither here nor there.

What caught my attention was in the blogs after the debate was over. I saw this blurb as part of a larger a... <a href="/2011/09/who-should-we-teach/">Read more</a>

    This past weekend my wife and I travelled up to South Bend, IN to spend the weekend with her family. Her youngest brother turned 16, and with both of his older siblings out of the house, we wanted to shake it up a little bit for such a large milestone in his life. My in-laws live out in the country on the west side of the city, and the cold fron... <a href="/2011/09/teaching-is-like-bowling/">Read more</a>
