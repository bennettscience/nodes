    Monday, September 10th is the 25th weekly #flipclass chat. After beginning back in March, we have had a great team of moderators form and had increased participation on a weekly basis.

One thing we discovered this summer was that live discussions using Goole+ Hangouts On-Air were a great way to bring in experts in flipping from all over the wor... <a href="/2012/09/special-flipclass-chat-monday-sept-10/">Read more</a>

    School is getting started again for just about everyone and as flipped learning becomes more and more popular, we’re all looking to make connections to continue our growth.

The first way is to join in on our #flipclass chat Monday nights at 8PM EDT. We have a wonderful team of moderators (many who are included below) that help host the chat eac... <a href="/2012/08/the-people-of-flipped-learning/">Read more</a>

    Where I am to Where I’m Going

By the time you read this post, I will have already began my school year, crossing my fingers, and praying that what I put into motion will pay off in dividends down the road. This year is a lot of firsts for me.

    If you had walked into our rooms the first week of school, you would have seen chaos. Complete and utter chaos. Students lining up to take their picture on our laptops for a class directory. Students wandering around campus, taking pictures that define the way they view school. Students watching a video on their smartphone while writing response... <a href="/2012/08/guest-post-alchemy-in-the-midst-of-chaos-collaboration-and-community-in-the-flipped-classroom/">Read more</a>

    This week, I will start my 20th year in the classroom, and for the first time, I really don’t know what I’m going to do. I should probably explain.

For the first eighteen years of my career, I was a good teacher. My lessons were planned, my curriculum was covered, my grades were recorded, my students were happy and successful. Everything was go... <a href="/2012/08/guest-post-a-brand-new-year/">Read more</a>

    After a horrendous start of the year (I won’t go into it here…) I was finally able to introduce the whole flipped classroom idea to my students today. They had a taste yesterday, but with the materials in hand and the technology to use, it finally began to click for many of my students.

    Things go wrong. It’s a fact that we have to embrace and learn to live with if we want to be great teachers. I’ve learned some of my most valuable teaching lessons from classes or activities melting down in front of me.

Adversity is inevitable when we work with other people. We have disagreements with colleagues, students will fight for somethi... <a href="/2012/08/three-responses-to-failure/">Read more</a>

    NOTE: This is a cross-post of a piece I wrote for SmartBlogs. You can see the original here.

Since Sal Khan’s 2011 TED Talk, the Khan Academy has been nearly synonymous with “flipped classrooms.” This is because since then, Khan Academy has been promoted by the Gates Foundation as well as major media outlets like CNN and CBS.
