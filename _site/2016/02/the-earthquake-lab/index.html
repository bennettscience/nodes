      <h1>
  The Earthquake Lab
</h1>



<p>Waves are tricky to teach. Students feel like they already have a ton of experience with them (you’ve been to the beach somewhere, I’m sure.) and that there isn’t a whole lot more to learn. So, I try to make it hands on and connect with other areas of interest.</p>

<p>For instance, I brought my guitar into school. Music is waves working well together. So, I fiddled around during class while they were working and had them make connections between the guitar and the theory of waves. A few days later, I moved into a NOVA episode about the 2011 Japan earthquake and resulting tsunami…more waves. Students were able to connect the abstract – longitudinal and transverse waves – with the concrete – P and S seismic waves. At this point I introduced the earthquake lab.</p>

<h3 id="the-setup">The Setup</h3>

<p>Students broke into teams of four and assigned roles – Project Manager, Treasurer, Research Director, Architect – based on their interests. Their task was to build a building at least 40cm tall out of spaghetti, marshmallows, and tape which would stand up to an earthquake. <a href="http%3A%2F%2Fmsjanaulis.weebly.com%2Fuploads%2F2%2F4%2F3%2F2%2F2432202%2Fspaghetti_earthquake_lab.doc&amp;">I modified this doc (Word download)</a> and gave one sheet per group.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>

<p>When I assigned this task, I said the structure had to be <em>at least</em> 40cm tall, but I didn’t tell them that it should be <em>as tall as possible</em>. Some groups naturally went for it (one group hit 98cm!) while others played it safe. Next time, the height challenge will be added.</p>

<p>Also, if you look at the document, I dropped the line of credit to $4000, thinking it would make them think through their designs. I also limited their trips to the store (me) to two visits to <em>really</em> make sure they designed. Nearly every group was very intentional, but I still wish I had added the “economy” challenge to the height: tallest building you can make (at least 40cm) while staying cheap. Things to remember for next year…</p>

<h3 id="the-shaker">The Shaker</h3>

<p>The final hurdle was designing an earthquake machine that would shake every building fairly. I also wanted them to see the difference between P and S waves, so it had to shake on two axes. I tried to work through a couple of ideas which would have required cranks, drills, drawer sliders, and lots of engineering and instead landed on something sweet and simple: a tone generator on our LabQuest sets and a hacked apart speaker.</p>

<p><small>S Wave arrangement: lateral speaker with the LabQuest hooked up.</small></p>

<p>I used some 10-gauge house wire and industrial strength hot glue to add some hooks to the speaker baffle. A small power source let me control the volume of the tone being generated. I drilled holes through a small whiteboard to mount on top of a speaker (P waves) and beside a speaker (S waves). We ran the P waves at around 25Hz and the S between 10-12Hz. The goal was to show students how properly-built buildings resonate <em>with</em> the shake, not fight against it.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="true" muted="" src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/earthquake.mp4" width="640" height="auto"></video>

<p>It gave a pretty good shake…my speakers this year were a little small, but it worked well to show resonance. I think if we went for height next year, we’d get a few more building failures, which are <em>just</em> as important as building successes.</p>
