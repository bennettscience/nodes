  Natural Consequences
</h1>



<p>This is the hardest part of teaching, if you ask me. What are the natural consequences of not completing a task in the given amount of time?</p>

<p>It started with a tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alicekeeler">Alice Keeler</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    STOP THE MYTH! Not one shred of research supports homework teaching responsibility. It is not true. Stop saying that.
  </p>
  
  <p>

<p>…and it really snowballed.</p>

<p>Homework – and whether or not to assign it – is extremely personal. It’s a methodological decision that (often) is tied very closely to the culture of learning a teacher tries to set up in their room.</p>

<p>Homework is divisive.</p>

<p>I teach high school…mostly 10th and 11th grade. Part of my responsibility to to <em>teach</em> responsibility to my students. Everything I do in my class rolls back around to life skills (this is called <em>organic curriculum</em> in the literature. See Glatthorn (1999) for more) and preparing them for their obligations once they leave the building.</p>

<p>I’m not naive. I know students are dealing with much, much more than I ever have. I have multiple students with children. Many with jobs. Most with clubs, athletics, and other extracurricular work. I also have some homeless, transient, and students dealing with significant adversity.</p>

<p>And it is my responsibility to make sure they’re learning.</p>

<p>We use class time to make sure that happens. I give plenty of time to work through content. I’m here to help. They work in groups. They can ask questions, make mistakes, reflect, and revise in a safe place.</p>

<p>But sometimes, students make decisions to not use the class time. <strong>That’s</strong> when it becomes homework.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/justinaion">Justin Aion</a> wrote a <a href="http://blog.relearningtoteach.com/2015/10/day-27-responsibility.html">great post</a> which summarizes many of my thoughts on teaching responsibility. In particular,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At some point, the role of a teacher, in my opinion, slowly shifts to support, gradually handing off the responsibility for education to the student, helping them to become more and more independent before we release them into the world.</p>

  <p>I struggle regularly with finding that balance. This year, with juniors and seniors, I am much more inclined to leave the responsibility up to them. I make myself available and do my best to support them, but the responsibility for learning and decision making is on them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it irresponsible of me to ask that work not finished in the time given during the day be finished outside of class? For high schoolers, I don’t think so. Mainly because I know what support they’ve had during the day(s) of work on the task and really, anything leftover, should be minimal.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem: <strong>none of these conversations about homework consider the support already given.</strong></p>

<p>It’s dogmatic. A kneejerk. And it’s hurting education discussions.</p>

<p>If I don’t finish work, I have to find time to do it. Period.</p>

<p>Why is it different for our students?</p>

<p>I’m here after school. I’m here before school. We have an advisory period. I can implore, beg, and even assign, but there is still a conscious decision made by a student to either take advantage of those opportunities or not. If they don’t, the only reasonable expectation that I have is that they do it at home.</p>

<p>Blaming the teacher for a student’s indiscretion is like blaming the principal for not getting your grades done on time. There is a set time period and it needs to get done.</p>

<p>Does homework – in and of itself – teach responsibility? No. Of course not. Neither does bringing a pencil to class. All I ask is that we start to look beyond the <em>action</em> and include the support system in place. What <em>else</em> is done? What could be improved? What might need to be dropped?</p>

<p>I left that discussion feeling angry and frustrated because we stuck to the idea that “all homework is bad.” To someone new to Twitter – and even someone old on Twitter – it comes across as a personal attack. I think Glenn Arnold said it best afterward:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <a href="https://twitter.com/bennettscience">@bennettscience</a> no, old me would have too. But then I realize I'm not accountable to them, but to my Ss. And I still want to engage&#8230;
  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I (usually) enjoy the discussion…this time, I’m enjoying the reflection (again, Justin’s &lt;a href=”“http://blog.relearningtoteach.com/2015/10/day-27-responsibility.html”&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; is great). We need to think big picture. Forget homework – it’s a single thing that can influence learning. Let’s talk about the larger systems or cultures we’re building…<em>that’s</em> a discussion I can get into.</p>
