    I’m trying to capture the small moments each day with short posts. I feel like I glaze over these moments too quickly and I lose out on one of the joys of teaching.

Today, I had a chance to work with a couple of girls really struggling with a concept. I rephrased, remediated, and gave new examples. The frustration was tangible and you could tel... <a href="/2011/11/the-greatest-struggle-part-ii/">Read more</a>

    I had an interesting conversation with our pre-service teacher this morning concerning a make up quiz she had given to her chemistry class. In short, the learner used “ammonia” for her answer to the prompt “NH3.” In chemistry, this is perfectly acceptable as “ammonia” is used regularly, even though it is a common term for a substance. It is wide... <a href="/2011/11/the-hidden-message/">Read more</a>

    I’m a glass-half-full kind of guy. I think to be a teacher, you have to be. If I didn’t have the ability to look on the bright side, I wouldn’t want to go back the next day. Part of that is because of the stories I see and hear each day. Some of my kids go through heartbreak and deal with bigger issues than I’ve ever had to.

    A few weeks ago, I came to Twitter lamenting the abysmal grades from a quiz I had given. You’d think I had learned my lesson at that point…well, I didn’t. I gave another quiz today and I didn’t even finish grading the stack of papers. That got me thinking about what I’m really running into problems with.

    Last weekend I had the privilege of attending EdCamp: Grand Rapids hosted by the extraordinary Ron Houtman. About 100 educators from all over Michigan (and a couple from Indiana) came together to talk about current education practice, major shifts in policy, and pretty much anything else under the sun.

At the conference I had the chance to list... <a href="/2011/11/save-our-schools/">Read more</a>

    I spent some time this afternoon updating my grade book. Like most of us, grading is my least favorite part of teaching and I have a nasty habit of putting it off for longer than I should. I end up having marathon grading stints after school and it usually seems to coincide with other things I would rather be doing.

Anyways, I was putting grade... <a href="/2011/11/grades-revisited/">Read more</a>

    I went to Kentucky this weekend to visit my parents. It was a great weekend and I’m glad I was able to spend some time away from thinking about teaching or grading. We all need refreshers…make sure you take them periodically.

When I returned home Sunday afternoon, I had a stack of exams waiting to be graded. We have just finished a chapter on b... <a href="/2011/10/the-greatest-struggle/">Read more</a>

and it really got me thinking. What is innovation? I can see what Steven is getting at. What happens when everyone is innovating…is that not innovation anymore?

    The flipped class has been coming up more and more in discussions and blog posts recently. My guess is that it has something to do with Salman Khan’s lucrative relationship with Bill Gates and the media’s attention on their speaking tours. I feel like a broken record with this post, but it is something that needs to be written again.

    First quarter drew to a close this past Friday. I, along with the rest of the school, have been frantically working to find missing assignments, compile grades, and try to provide meaningful feedback with the pre-determined statements given to us. Such fun.
