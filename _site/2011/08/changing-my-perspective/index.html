      <h1>
  Changing My Perspective
</h1>



<p>Our internet was out at school today (it’s okay, it came back on around lunchtime) and it gave me a chance to slow down a little bit during my plan period to re-arrange my thoughts and take a few deep breaths.  I met Jeff Utecht at a conference last March and at his workshop, he gave us a code to download a free copy of his book, <em><a href="http://www.jeffutecht.com/reach" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Reach</a></em>.  I had all of my lesson plans done and nothing to copy, so with no internet to browse or Twitter to lurk, I took the time to read the book that has been sitting on my desktop since March.</p>

<p>It’s a short book on building professional networks…only about 100 pages.  Most of it is about different types of social networking (ie Twitter vs Facebook or Wikis) and how each can play a role in our PLNs.  A lot of it I’ve already done, but there were still some good tidbits and thoughts about tools available to build and augment my learning network.</p>

<p>The part that really stood out to me was in Chapter 2 when he writes about building our communities and networks for learning.  He used three different terms: <em>print literacy, digital literacy,</em> and <em>network literacy.</em>  As I thought about it, I had realized that I knew the difference between print and digital literacy, but my continuum stopped there.  I had never thought about what each of those meant.  Jeff’s words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By these definitions digital literacy looks at understanding technologies and their uses. It’s everything from understanding folder structures on a computer to being able to successfully use e-mail to communicate with others (<em>Reach</em> p 29).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had always thought digital literacy was so much more, but when I read that, it made a lot of sense that today’s kids are already digital literate.  They are probably more literate than me in most cases when it comes to new technology coming out.  The problems I see when we’re using the computers are definitely in the network literacy.  I’m even more glad now that  I decided to go with class blogs this year.  Again, Jeff’s words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Networked literacy is what the web is about. It’s about understanding how people and communication networks work. It’s the understanding of how to find information and how to be found. It’s about how to read hyperlinked text articles, and understand the connections that are made when you become “friends” or “follow” someone on a network. It’s the understanding of how to stay safe and how to use the networked knowledge that is the World Wide Web. Networked Literacy is about understanding connections (<em>Reach</em> p. 30).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am network literate.  I have learned how to use Twitter, Google+, blogs, and other tools to build my learning network into something personal and useful for my work.  This is what we need to be teaching kids now.  They know how to <em>use</em> a computer, but that doesn’t mean they know how to <em>connect</em> with a computer.</p>

<p>Today in class, students were amazed that people from other countries had read some of the blogs.  To me, that’s totally normal because I have built that global perspective for myself.  The change in perspective is a good reminder that to accomplish my goals this year, I need to be teaching networks and not just focusing on the “digital.”</p>
