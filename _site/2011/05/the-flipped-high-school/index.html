    Greg Green, Principal

</div>

<p>As I was browsing the internet this morning, I noticed a new discussion has been posted on the <a href="http://vodcasting.ning.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Vodcasting and Flipped Class Network</a>. It was a forum post by Greg Green, principal of <a href="http://seatwaitingforyou.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109&amp;Itemid=444" target="_blank">Clintondale High School</a> in the metro-Detroit area. With all of the work I’ve done with building a flipped class, this quickly stood out to me and I immediately began reading in earnest.</p>

<p>Some background: Greg’s school is 72% free and reduced lunch and has a minority base of 65% African American and 35% Caucasian in the school. He didn’t provide many details about the project in his original post, so I wrote him an e mail.  I mentioned that I had done some presenting on the flipped class and that I was curious to hear about the decision making process that was involved in deciding to flip the <em>entire</em> school in one go.  Here’s what Greg had to say in his response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We actually developed a pilot class in Government/Economics with our most at-risk students. This class flipped and we kept a less at-risk class more traditional.  At the end of the pilot we found the at-risk class outperformed the regular class. We used the same teacher and the same assessments.  Every student did every assignment!!  Next we decided to flip our most at-risk group of students…9th grade.  Within our 9th grade we have reduced our failure rate in ELA by 33%, Math 31% Science 22% and SS 19%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is evidence of the flipped classroom at its best.  Greg has given the support to teachers to make an effective change in a difficult situation.  He went on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With our flip, I have found that the flip classroom aligns our school resources with our students needs.  In a traditional school, we ask students to process, inquire and develop their skills outside of class.  However, with an at-risk student how do they do that[?] So it was pretty clear that we had to flip our classrooms to meet the needs of our students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a man I want to meet.  Greg understands that the entire purpose of education is to meet the needs of the students, not to have comfortable, routine-driven teachers.</p>

<p>One of my biggest questions had to do with the enormous undertaking of recording the <em>entire</em> curriculum for the next school year.  Greg explained that the school (as a whole, cooperative unit) was “…creating screen captures as departments and automating the delivery of those captures out to our students.”  Cooperation in this task is essential for effective implementation and I want to commend the entire staff for setting a great example of a functional, cohesive school working together for student growth.</p>

<p>For those crying out “standardization is bad!” here is some food for thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This keeps teachers from varying from the curriculum and allows us to effectively evaluate our learning within the classroom because our delivery of our message has not varied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Standardization of content helps students make long-lasting connections that will lead to higher order thinking.  This is a great example of standardization at its best.  Teachers still have the autonomy to make their own decisions about the class, but now, the entire faculty <em>knows</em> what to expect from <em>every</em> student at the completion of every year.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re thinking, “This would be great if I were in a 1:1 school, too,” this is Greg’s closing thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not have a 1:1 student to technology ratio. Technology and presentation tools have been purchased for the classrooms instead of textbooks to stay well within budget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The money is there.  The technology resources are available.  All it takes is a vision for something bigger and better than what has done in the past to make significant changes in kid’s lives.</p>

<p>Congratulations Greg and staff of Clintondale High School.  You are modeling effective education and I hope, someday, to be able to set as good an example as you.</p>
