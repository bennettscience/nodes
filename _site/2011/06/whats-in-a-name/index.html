<p>…or, “More Reflections on the Flipped Class.”</p>

<p>I’ve been inundating myself with discussion on the Flipped Classroom recently.  First, there was the FlipClass11 conference where we had about 140 teachers come from around the US and Canada (and even one Londoner I heard) to learn about the flipped classroom.  I was honored to be selected to be a member of the presenting team for that conference and I am still sorting through a lot of discussions I had with teachers about what a flipped class looks like.</p>

<p>Then, I was honored to co-write a 3-part article on the flipped class, hosted by The Daily Riff.  <a href="http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-conversation-689.php" target="_blank">You can see all three parts in sequence</a> on The Daily Riff’s website still.</p>

<p>Today, Jon Bergmann asked if I would set aside time for #edchat because it was going to be on…the flipped class and its implications in education.</p>

<p>The #edchat session was awesome with great thoughts coming from <a href="http://mrbernia.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">John Bernia</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mthornton78" target="_blank">Michael Thornton</a>, and <a href="http://trice25.edublogs.org/" target="_blank">Tyler Rice</a>, especially.  The biggest question was “If you’re trying to move away from lecture, don’t your videos keep the lecture component as a major part of the class?”  To that question, I would unquestionably answer “yes, BUT…” because while I still have a “lecture” component, I can now do so much more with my class time.  Allow me to back up for a moment.</p>

<p>I’m only a second year teacher, so I know next to nothing compared to some of the veterans I get to talk with every day.  I was taught to stand and deliver, as were most other teachers working today.  It is deep-rooted tradition in American education, and there is <em>nothing wrong with that</em>. I began to question, though, how I can get more collaborative work and inquiry learning into my curriculum.  That slowly transformed into: “How can I use technology to enhance my class?” I found a partial answer in flipping…but I didn’t <em>know</em> it was a partial answer until very recently.  <a href="http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-what-does-a-good-one-look-like-692.php" target="_blank">I saw amazing things happening in my class as I flipped</a> that (unfortunately) probably wouldn’t have happened otherwise.  Students self-grouping and collaborating, “low-achieving” students finding more success than they’ve ever found, and kids that were <em>terrified</em> of chemistry growing to love it.</p>

<p>That being said, using video podcasts to deliver instruction may be lecture in spirit, but <em>it is a stepping stone that allows us lecturers to move toward more inquiry and collaborative work in our classes</em>. Without that time freed up, I <em>never</em> would have discovered other ways to help kids learn chemistry. The flipped class is so much more than the name implies, and that is the message I’m trying to spread now.</p>

<p>Yeah, videos work great…but I’m already bored with them and I’ve found other, more meaningful ways to help kids learn the material. Will I still keep videos? Maybe, because they <strong>can</strong> be useful for review or for learning very algorithmic processes. Will I keep them all? Probably not. I’d rather use my time (and have my learners use their time) to do more meaningful, collaborative work than sit and listen to me talk from their iPod.</p>

<p>So, is the “Flipped Classroom” a misnomer? Maybe. But don’t look at the name and instantly turn away because we’re all “hypocrites” (and yes, I have been called a hypocrite). Think <em>beyond</em> the videos and try to work out ways you can use some of the ideas the flipped class will give you time for. If videos won’t work for you, please don’t use them. If they will, then maybe they’re a good starting point.</p>

<p>Just don’t judge a book by its title.</p>
