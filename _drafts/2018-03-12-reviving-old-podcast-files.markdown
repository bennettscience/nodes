In 2013 and 2014, I hosted a podcast for TechSmith with the EdReach Network. EdReach, from what I can tell, has stopped serving media and has focused solely on contributed writing. The site is somewhat of a mishmash, where I'm able to dig around and find old show landing pages, but none of the media is there. The Wayback Machine had several hundred snapshots between 2012 and 2017, including some in 2014 which had the entire show lexicon listed. But, since none of the media are currently available (404 errors, probably because they deleted all of the old material), none of the audio is available.

I _happened_ to find seven of the original 24 episodes in my Google Drive. I listened to each one today at work and had some great memories of the interviews. The music is definitely moody and you can tell I was going for a This American Life vibe, and I'm a little embarrassed by the blatant imitation, but I enjoyed listening to the old shows.

If you want to listen, each episode is embedded below with the show notes and a download link to the original mp3 file if you want to take it for later.
