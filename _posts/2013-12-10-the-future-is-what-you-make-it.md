See what I did there? That took a significant amount of brain power tonight. It must be the end of the semester.

CEP811 is closing this week and for my final post with that particular tag, I&#8217;m going to reflect a little bit. I&#8217;ll try not to ramble too much.

Long story short: I&#8217;ll definitely be using the Raspberry Pi when I get back to the classroom someday. This course was a particular challenge for me because everything I&#8217;ve planned and written about has been _in spe_. (That&#8217;s Latin, folks.) So, while I can&#8217;t go and do some of the things I&#8217;ve written about tomorrow, I have them filed away for the future. The big thing about maker tools is that _they can do whatever we want them to do_. The Raspberry Pi, for me, is something that will allow one more student to explore something they might be interested in. Sure, there are times I&#8217;ll bring it into what we do to pique some interest, but like any other tool, it&#8217;s not something I can require every student to engage with. I get wary when we talk about &#8220;every student should need to learn how to code,&#8221; because that&#8217;s ignoring the fact that every student has different strengths, weaknesses, and interests. 

If the tools in my classroom encourage students to think, to question, or to explore (play?), then I think they&#8217;re effective. I want to see students take risks and I want to provide a variety of modes for them to risk with. It isn&#8217;t about the curriculum I design to go specifically with the Pi, but the challenge it will present to learners. I want to evaluate how they rise to meet that challenge and how they cope with dealing with new tools. We see this happening as young as first grade now with [designing lunch boxes](http://aflippedapproach.blogspot.com/2013/12/you-know-who-awesome.html). It isn&#8217;t about having fancy tools or toys, but how we engage our students.

Socrates denied being a teacher because he didn&#8217;t fit the definition given by culture. I feel this is something we battle today. Culturally, a teacher is someone who stands in front of students, a content expert, to instruct. Metaphysically, teachers are so much more than that:

So, how will the maker ideas fit into my class? _They should already be there_. I need to be addressing and encouraging student&#8217;s innate desire to be creators, explorers, and discoverers. Sure, the Raspberry Pi will help me do that. But it isn&#8217;t about the device&#8230;it&#8217;s about the pedagogy we bring to give context to the tool.

Looking back, I wish I had been more aggressive with my own maker project plans. I don&#8217;t have a working program like I had hoped to, and that&#8217;s mostly because I didn&#8217;t make it a priority through the course. I think had I continued that project through each week, I would have felt like each week had more of a connection. However, I do feel like I pushed myself to think beyond the obvious with each prompt. I wanted to get to the root of my beliefs and draw out each component of the class as much as I could. I challenged myself to take risks and write provocatively, and through that, I have been able to reframe some of my core beliefs about education.
