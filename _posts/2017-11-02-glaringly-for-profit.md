[Audrey Watters](https://twitter.com/audreywatters) shared a Bloomberg article this morning on Silicon Valley-based AltSchool which is [closing locations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-01/silicon-valley-tried-to-reinvent-schools-now-it-s-rebooting) to focus on &#8220;strategy&#8221; and a &#8220;path to growth and finances.&#8221; It&#8217;s a glaring admission that Silicon Valley money and &#8220;vision&#8221; have nothing to do with bettering education for students.

Interestingly, the last paragraph of the article highlights what we already know about improving schools, almost as an afterthought:

<p class="pullquote">
  <span>Although the company touts the magic of its technology, two parents said their children benefited more from the extensive attention of talented teachers and small class sizes.</span>
