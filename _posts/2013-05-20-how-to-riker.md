Week 1 of the summer [ds106](http://www.ds106.us) course has begun, and I&#8217;m trying to stay on top of the work and do as much as I can with the rest of the summer cohort. I feel like I&#8217;ve got the chops, I just hope I have the time.

Today, to kick things off, we have a [Design Assignment](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/how-to-_________/) from the bank. This assignment asked us to create an image for a fictional character with the title of &#8220;How to \___\___\___.&#8221; (Meaning, how to emulate said character.)

I&#8217;ve been on a [ST:TNG](http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-the-next-generation) (follow the link if you don&#8217;t know what that is) kick recently, so I decided to model my guide on the ever-present [Commander Riker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Riker). Always there, letting his beard shine out (at least after season 1), playing sweet brass tunes on his trombone, and in general, being a 24th-century-bad-ass-womanizer when Worf wasn&#8217;t around.

I did this by grabbing a picture of Riker online and then using the free select tool in GIMP to grab his beard, hair, and to chop out his mouth. Then, badabing-border, badaboom-text, and there it is.

In the spirit of remixing, I&#8217;m also going to post my GIMP files on my server that you can download, remix, and play with. It should save some work for everyone in the end. You can grab the Riker .xcf here.
