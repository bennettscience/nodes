October was Connected Educator&#8217;s Month. (Soapbox moment: I can&#8217;t wait until we can get rid of these silly &#8220;awareness months.&#8221; Okay, I&#8217;m done). I&#8217;ve been on Twitter for almost three years and I was curious about what engagement actually _looked_ like for a given period of time. So, I decided to do a little experiment.

## Gathering Data

On October 1, I turned on all of the notifications for Twitter except for DM&#8217;s and Replies. Those are easy enough to count with a tool given to me by [LivingTree](http://www.twitter.com/raisethepride) called [Twitonomy](http://www.twitonomy.com/). I was more interested in two things:

  * How many RT&#8217;s and Favorited tweets would I get
  * What kind of tweets were favorited and retweeted.

Unless you have email notifications (which I hate) turned on, you don&#8217;t get to see your RT&#8217;s and favorited tweets in the 3rd party Twitter clients. (Sidebar number two: you should use a [management app](http://web.tweetdeck.com). Twitter on the web is _horrible_.)

## The Process

Like a good scientist, I had a couple of controls. First, I didn&#8217;t tell anyone I was doing this. I didn&#8217;t want to sway the normal activity of my normal interactions. So, for those of you who unwillingly contributed, thank you. Second, I didn&#8217;t change my habits of tweeting. I tweeted jokes, nonsense, commentary, snark, resources, articles, pictures&#8230;pretty much business as usual. Again, I didn&#8217;t want to saturate my stream with some kind of bias for results.

I broke my tweeting habits up into four groups:

  1. Commentary
  2. Resources
  3. Blog Posts
  4. Other

**Commentary** &#8211; This was off the cuff comments, statements, snark, or other general statements about what I was thinking at the time.

## The Data

I went through all of the interactions and put them into a Google spreadsheet to visualize the data a little bit.

For the mentions, I decided to subtract my reported (via email) RT&#8217;s from my mentions count in order to get a more accurate number. I used two different means to get these numbers, so they&#8217;re probably double counted.

I went into this expecting that articles and blog posts would draw the highest level of engagement on Twitter. I was really surprised to see that my offhand comments were the most interacted-with.

And I think part of my surprise in the results is because I didn&#8217;t set up an easy way (at the beginning) to track the interactions (specifically, Mentions) for each individual tweet. All I measured was the number of times a particular tweet was RT&#8217;d or favorited, which isn&#8217;t really interacting at all&#8230;at least not in the traditional sense.

## The Deep Stuff

Twitter is a funny machine&#8230;it allows people from across the world to interact with one another, but not under the obligation of actually _interacting_ with them. I had no idea how many times particular tweets were retweeted by followers. So, while they were resonating with something I had said or shared, I wasn&#8217;t aware of that interaction. So, the question going through my mind right now is: 

> &#8220;Is it _my_ fault for not interacting and engaging a follower, or _their_ fault for not reaching out and engaging with me?&#8221;

I decided to create a really official sounding, yet totally made up, metric for my engagement in October. I&#8217;m calling it the **Engagement Quotient**. (Sounds good, right?) I got this by dividing the number of Mentions by my total Tweets for the time period.

<img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/TSCBennett/folders/Snagit/media/590ed6f7-9e19-4361-b8cb-293190b504e4/2013-10-29_22-23-52.jpeg" class="aligncenter" />

To get this, I wanted to know what percentage of my Tweets encouraged some kind of direct response from someone as a Mention.

Out of 689 tweets in October, I received 542 mentions, giving me an EQ score of 79%.

In reality, this means absolutely nothing. But, to me, it means that _something_ I&#8217;m doing is engaging my PLN. And that means I&#8217;m contributing to the discussion in some way, which makes me feel good about being a connected person/educator/male/whatever.

In the future, I want to have some better goals set up from day one. A lot of this came toward the end of the month as I thought about what it means to be engaged. So, while it is mildly scientific in nature (I had tables and charts), it could have been more so. Maybe I&#8217;ll do it again in a few months and see if it changes based on season. I&#8217;m not sure.
