The language I use around grading is very specific, especially when I&#8217;m speaking with students.

&#8220;Your grade is based on how much you learn. You must show me that you&#8217;ve learned.&#8221;

I also have a go-to response when students ask if a particular paper will be graded:

&#8220;The paper itself isn&#8217;t important. However, the work you do on the paper can demonstrate learning, which is how you&#8217;re graded. Second, and more importantly, mistakes you make on paper help me help you.&#8221;

Students usually agree with this sentiment. Until grades come around.

&#8220;I did all the papers! Why is my grade so low?&#8221;

&#8220;You haven&#8217;t demonstrated _learning_ yet. What would you like to show me?&#8221;

&#8220;&#8230;but I did all the papers.&#8221;

The language is the same, but we&#8217;re speaking past one another. Until we can make clear the distinction between the _process_ of learning and the _demonstration_ (which can certainly happen in the process), we&#8217;ll continue to fight culture.
