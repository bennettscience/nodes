I&#8217;ve done a lot of writing this past week. I mean, a _lot_. Many late nights, cups of coffee, and pints of beer went into my body and magically flowed through my fingers and into my paper.

For class, we were asked to create a personal manifesto which outlines skills essential to teaching. Along with a narrative of why we chose those skills to highlight, we pulled articles, blog posts, journals, videos&#8230;anything we&#8217;ve used in the past for growth to share with our readers.

I boiled mine down to nine skills essential to teaching. I outline this in the introduction of my paper, but I approached this from behaviors or attitudes rather than &#8220;hard&#8221; classroom skills like instruction and management. I did this partially because I think skills like _Balance_ and _Compassion_ are oft overlooked in teacher preparation programs. I also think the way we approach the relational side of teaching dictates our effectiveness in the classroom. I have no way to support that claim other than it&#8217;s been my experience, but I&#8217;ll stand by it.

I&#8217;d also like to thank [Karl Lindgren-Streicher](http://www.twitter.com/LS_Karl), [Lindsay Cole](http://www.twitter.com/lindsaybcole), and [Christiane Schicke](http://www.twitter.com/frandevol) for taking the time to leave comments as I was still writing.
