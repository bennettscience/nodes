This may be the longest stretch I&#8217;ve gone without writing anything on the blog. My last post was on September 26th, and for various reasons, I haven&#8217;t been able to add any new content. Now, because I know there are throngs of people waiting with bated breath to see what happens next, this is more of a digest of the past month in an effort to clear my head of the many things that have been floating around.

**Homes** &#8211; My wife and I are trying to buy a house. If you&#8217;ve gone through the mortgage process, then I&#8217;m guessing I don&#8217;t need to say much more. In between trying to explain why I don&#8217;t have a credit history and talking about interest rates, I barely have enough brain power to think about what it actually means to buy a house.

**Flipped Learning** &#8211; I have officially joined the board of the Flipped Learning Network, the not-for-profit organization that organizes and manages different events surrounding flipped learning. I&#8217;m enjoying it a lot, but it is a big addition to my already busy schedule at school. On that note, however, I&#8217;m beginning a bigger social media presence for the FLN. [Follow us on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/flippedlearning) for periodic updates and announcements surrounding flipped learning.

**School** &#8211; For whatever reason, this school year has seemed more busy that every other year, including my first year. Perhaps it is everything else I&#8217;m involved in, but I&#8217;m working harder in school than I ever have in the past. I&#8217;m still trying to use a simple standards-based grading system with my students, and we&#8217;re continuing to work together to iron out problems. I&#8217;m also in the midst of transitioning my web design class to a computer applications class in which students can choose different foci or tracks to pursue. Rather than focusing on web design, they&#8217;ll be able to work on photography or photo editing, video and film, music composition, or web design. I&#8217;ve been curating content and I&#8217;m nearly ready to begin organizing into a syllabus and path for them to follow.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll get back to writing again someday. Thanks for continuing to read and interact with me on Twitter. You&#8217;re all a fantastic help, and my learning wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as rich without you.
