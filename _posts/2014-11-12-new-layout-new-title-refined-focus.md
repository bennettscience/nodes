I&#8217;ve iterated on this blog a lot over the years. I started by focusing on chemistry, and then switched over to teaching and learning in general. Layouts changed, content evolved, and it&#8217;s time for one more shift for (what I hope) is the last time.

I&#8217;ve grown a _lot_ as a teacher. I&#8217;ve gone from being staunchly opposed or advocating for certain ideas, fighting tooth and nail over ideology and finer points of what happens in the classroom. I&#8217;ve learned that language is important, and that healthy debate can help advance practice.

I&#8217;ve also learned that fighting over minor differences in opinion can stagnate growth and entrench ideas before they&#8217;re fully realized for the sake of sticking to your guns. I&#8217;ve wrestled with the idea of having a &#8220;thing&#8221; to platform myself on and how to use that to leverage opportunities and discussions. Rather than dive down the holes of what practice is &#8220;best,&#8221; I&#8217;ve decided to step back.

I&#8217;m interested in teaching and learning. I&#8217;m interested in technology. I want to explore how technology can intersect with teaching and learning in powerful ways.

I&#8217;m going to be working to tweak the layout and usability of the new site, but I want to point out that all of the old content is still here. So, links aren&#8217;t broken and posts aren&#8217;t missing. I&#8217;m looking for ideas, debate, and growth.

If you&#8217;re a reader, thanks for reading.
