I had a severe case of the &#8220;Mondays&#8221; today for some reason. My patience was thin and kids seemed to be a little bit more opinionated about their assignments than normal. Needless to say, it led to some rough edges for me and some of my students. Those days are unavoidable and I really hate it when they come around.

Days like today are when my PLN come to my rescue. I sent this tweet around lunchtime:

[Lindsay Cole](http://www.twitter.com/lindsaybcole) sent this tweet back:

For me, this is always the longest part of the year. We have a big stretch with few breaks and we are working through the heaviest part of the curriculum. Edges are frayed and brains are fried. When the going gets tough, remember, there is a room full of students that need us to make the choice to be present and be at our best, even if we do not feel like it.

Whether they know it or not, your students are reaching out for you. Will you reach back?
