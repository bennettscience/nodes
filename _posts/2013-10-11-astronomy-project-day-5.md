I worked a little bit tonight on my code while Lindsey got to bed early while the baby napped. I added a menu at the beginning of the program which prompts the user to select either Stars or Planets. Then, they can put their choice in.

This is a short-term implementation for a few of reasons:

  1. For users without the PyEphem library, I need to see if I can push a download or package the data somehow.
  2. I don&#8217;t want to have a ton of menus to go through
  3. The star library is pretty small. It&#8217;s good enough now, but I need to find another one to tap into.
  4. The code is &#8220;chunky.&#8221; I want to go through and streamline when I&#8217;m more awake.

I keep thinking about how much more I&#8217;m learning working on this project as opposed to when I tried to learn Python using arbitrary lessons. It&#8217;s really driving home the idea of interest-based learning and it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m going to forget any time soon.

If you want to see and try the new code, you can [fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/TSCBennett/astro).
