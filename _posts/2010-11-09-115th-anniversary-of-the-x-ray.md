Yesterday was the 115th anniversary of the discovery of the X-Ray.  [Physics Buzz](http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/), a blog run by PhysicsCentral.com, ran an [interesting post](http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2010/11/x-ray-vision-its-not-just-for-superman.html) on the X-Ray.  It was good as my class is finishing up the unit on energy in atoms and the electromagnetic spectrum.

Have a good Tuesday&#8230;
