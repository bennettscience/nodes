_Update 9:00 PM &#8211; I added a link to the docking procedure run earlier this morning._

If you teach science, get on Twitter or Facebook and follow [NASA](http://www.twitter.com/nasa). Now.

I know a ton of science happens here on the ground, but what I love about NASA is that they&#8217;ve embraced the fact that science can be shared with social media. They have one of the _best_ online presences by an organization I&#8217;ve ever seen. They have Twitter accounts for most of their major missions, including the Voyager spacecraft (which are still operating, if you didn&#8217;t know).

They livestream most of their [satellite launches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxQIyL0mIQI) so anyone can watch.

Heck, this afternoon, I watched a [Russian supply probe dock with the ISS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9tjdkp-vZs) **live**. That was quickly followed up by a tweet from a Canadian astronaut _on the space station_.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck">

    Progress 50 just docked to our Space Station! I was right at the hatch, it made a quick sliding scraping noise & then a solid thud. Success!

Long story short, NASA is making science _real_ for an audience that will (most likely) never get the chance to experience the work they do first-hand. I share it with my students. Maybe, one of them will see what science is all about and be inspired to begin a science career.

I want to go to space now.
