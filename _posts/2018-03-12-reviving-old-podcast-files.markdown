In 2013 and 2014, I hosted a podcast for TechSmith with the EdReach Network. EdReach, from what I can tell, has stopped serving media and has focused solely on contributed writing. The site is somewhat of a mishmash, where I'm able to dig around and find old show landing pages, but none of the media is there. The Wayback Machine had several hundred snapshots between 2012 and 2017, including some in 2014 which had the entire show lexicon listed. But, since none of the media are currently available (404 errors, probably because they deleted all of the old material), none of the audio is available.

I _happened_ to find six of the original 24 episodes in my Google Drive. I listened to each one today at work and had some great memories of the interviews. The music is definitely moody and you can tell I was going for a This American Life vibe, and I'm a little embarrassed by the blatant imitation, but I enjoyed listening to the old shows.

If you want to listen, each episode is embedded below with the show notes and a download link to the original mp3 file if you want to take it for later.

    If there is a time to change, the time is now. Why wait? In this week’s episode, Cress and Little, aka Zach Cresswell and Steve Kelly, share their story of finding a friendship after a lifetime of knowing each other. A true case of the student becoming the master (Star Wars much, anyone?). A story of collaboration and growth between two math teachers who want to find a better way to teach. <br />If you’re looking for the video I played during the show, you can watch it below or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEwCpifexBk">watch it on YouTube</a>.

    Have you ever taken an online course and wondered if you were really doing work that was worth the effort? How much did you interact with other people in your class? Did you feel alone?
    <br />
    Unfortunately, that’s how a lot of online courses tend to be. But not this one. Meet Jim Groom and Alan Levine, two of the minds behind what is now known simply as ds106. In this episode, I talk with Alan and Jim about how ds106 is different from anything you’ve ever heard about. We’ve got open learning platforms, criticisms of MOOCs, and shameless self promotion. You won’t be disappointed.

    “We’re creating little, small warriors of crazy self-publishing.”<br />
    ds106 is all about creation in an open, collaborative community. It’s unstructured, it’s a community, and it’s a place to create in any way that you see fit. Jim and Alan are passionate about protecting that openness, and in this episode of Chalkstar to Rockstar, we hear their thoughts on how they do that and why it is so important.<br />
