The 6th Annual Flipped Learning Conference is being held this June 17-19 in Stillwater, MN. Registration is open, and I took it upon myself to generate a little buzz with some [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) fun. You can see each of the promotional fliers below. Feel free to repost them or Tweet.

We hope to see you in June.
