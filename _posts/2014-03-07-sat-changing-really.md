The edtech land is losing their minds of the second major revision to the SAT in nine years&#8217; time. [In case you missed it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=SAT+changing#).

Horray! The SAT is _finally_ getting on board with what _really_ matters!

Khan Academy will help more students get ready for the test! This will level the playing field!

The SAT isn&#8217;t changing. The announcement and following hullabaloo is a procedural shift to improve the appearance of the test without considering the deeper implications of standardized exit exams.

Students are still coerced into the exam by the testing machine and higher ed.

Students are still given an arbitrary rank (but it&#8217;s out of 1600 now) to show what they know.

The College Board is still making money.

David Coleman now has more control over the American curriculum (not really, but really).

Khan Academy can now pull in the test-prep market because videos.

The New York Times Magazine ran a <a href"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/the-story-behind-the-sat-overhaul.html">fantastic article</a> yesterday outlining how the major players came together in one magical-you-heard-it-at-SXSWEDU press event. I highly encourage you to read it.

I keep returning to a closing point in the article:

> With a redesigned SAT, Calkins thinks that too much of the nation’s education curriculum and assessment may rest in one person’s hands. “The issue is: Are we in a place to let Dave Coleman control the entire K-to-12 curriculum?”

Before we start celebrating a victory, can we please talk about the bigger implications of the curriculum and assessment that is marching on without the input of teachers? Aside from CCSS, the SAT, and the people involved, why aren&#8217;t we talking about learning? Why isn&#8217;t that newsworthy.

So much for change.
