I saw a post this afternoon about a new section of [#ds106](http://www.ds106.us) starting for a five-week summer course. I&#8217;ve dabbled in the Daily Creates from time to time, which included my very first-ever animated GIF,

  <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/gif2.gif"><img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/gif2.gif" alt="My first animated GIF." width="300" height="168" class="size-full wp-image-1753" /></a>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    My first animated GIF.
  </p>
</div> and I&#8217;ve enjoyed those a lot.

I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to jump in these next five weeks as an Open Online Participant. [Jim Groom](http://www.twitter.com/jimgroom) is teaching the course, and he&#8217;s taking it on a Twilight Zone trip. I remember watching old episodes with my dad when the SciFi channel wasn&#8217;t spelled &#8220;Sy-fy,&#8221; and I was still young enough to be freaked out by [&#8220;To Serve Man.&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone))

Another episode stands out in my head&#8230;it had something to do with a stopwatch. A [Google search later](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Twilight+Zone+stopwatch), I found what I was looking for. A man is given a stopwatch that can stop time. After becoming more confident in his new powers, well, let&#8217;s just say he ends up with a lot of time on his hands.

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Do you have a second to spare?
  </p>
</div>

Time is on my mind with this because of the time I&#8217;ll need to put into the class over the next month. And, with a house renovation starting Memorial Day weekend, I might be wishing I had a stopwatch of my own&#8230;
