My wife had been hinting that she wanted to use recipe cards in the kitchen rather than her phone all the time. So, I took a few hours and made some up using Inkscape. They&#8217;re clean and minimal and print out as 4&#215;6 cards on cardstock.

The font is a Futura clone, so no need to worry about royalties or licenses. 

You can download the Inkscape files if you want to tweak the design (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67244244/recipe_front.svg?dl=1" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">front</a>, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67244244/recipe_back.svg?dl=1" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">back</a>). Or here&#8217;s a ready-made PDF for your printing pleasure.
