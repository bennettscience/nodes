Google Slides got a big update from Google this week, notably the inclusion of AddOns and Apps Script functionality. The UI updates are nice (grid view, skip slide, etc) but the real power and extensibility of Slides through GAS allows for connection beyond the immediate audience.

Some ideas I know I&#8217;m going to play with:

&#8211; Auto tweet images of slides through a presentation to a hashtag

&#8211; Update slides with data/charts from a spreadsheet so data is always up to date

&#8211; Auto-generate photo slideshows from a Drive folder of images

&#8211; Memes. All the memes.

&#8212;
