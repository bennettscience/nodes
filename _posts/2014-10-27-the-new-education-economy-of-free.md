Have you ever been leading a session and been faced with the statement, &#8220;That&#8217;s great, but what does it cost?&#8221; The new economics of education rely on **free** as the baseline of worth in the classroom, and that&#8217;s bad for ideas and growth.

I know that money is tight<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. I&#8217;ve spent hundreds of my own dollars on classroom supplies, materials, lessons, and tissues&#8230;so many tissues. I&#8217;m concerned that the value of materials is rooted in what it costs rather than its instructional value, which is both good and bad for education.

> We need to differentiate between the free sharing of **ideas** and the free sharing of **products**.

The two are not synonymous, yet they are often equivocated. Consider the following:

I may share an idea on Twitter, my blog, or at a conference. It could be a lesson plan, a lab activity, or something to do with students learning. I have no ownership over any part of it, other than it&#8217;s something I came up with. The idea is ephemeral&#8230;it lives and dies with the action that&#8217;s taken. 

Someone reads or hears the idea and runs with it. They create a lesson plan, supplemental materials, and other products which can be shared &#8211; maybe even a curriculum or an ebook. 

Are they wrong for wanting to get some return on their investment of time and energy by asking for a small fee for those materials?

Depending on who you talk to, yes.

I didn&#8217;t ask anyone, but I know that making a living off of selling content is really, really hard in today&#8217;s education economy. What bothers me the most is that people (individuals, not corporations) who sell materials rather than giving them away are _really_ hearing, &#8220;My time as a teacher is valuable, but not what I make with that time.&#8221;

A refrain I hear is, &#8220;I give all of _my_ materials away for free, so others should do the same.&#8221; We&#8217;re projecting our own values onto others in the community! I can&#8217;t think of a much more damaging sentiment to communicate to colleagues. I&#8217;d even go so far as to say it&#8217;s bordering unethical behavior by expecting others to work with their products in a way that suits the community rather than their own goals. You can better a community and make money at the same time.

How many entrepreneurs have been stifled because of the &#8220;free-and-only-free&#8221; expectation? How many conference sessions have been unheard (or even commandeered) because it didn&#8217;t focus on free stuff? An economy of free isn&#8217;t sustainable, and I&#8217;m worried we&#8217;re losing valuable insight and growth opportunities because of the path we&#8217;re on.

Ideas vs. products. It&#8217;s important.
