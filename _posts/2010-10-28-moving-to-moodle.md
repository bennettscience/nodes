I&#8217;ve been running my course thus far via [Google sites](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/moving-to-moodle/) (which I love).  The site itself is easy to set-up, although the customization can take some playing around with.  After a PD session or two, I&#8217;m happy with my class website.  For my testing, I&#8217;ve been using another site called [ClassMarker.com](http://www.classmarker.com).  It is functional because of its class-organization system, so I can track each student for each test.  What I don&#8217;t like is it&#8217;s randomizing capabilities.  It can only randomize questions and their answers, and even then, only to a certain degree.  Also, there is no import function for test questions, so I have to enter each test item-by-item (and for roughly 100 questions per test, that can be very time consuming).

I have never used [Moodle](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/moving-to-moodle/) for my own class, but after seeing how other teachers use it, I&#8217;m a fledgling convert.  Moodle will organize all of my class materials by unit as well as host ALL of my testing.  Moodle&#8217;s testing also randomizes about 100x more efficiently than any subscription testing site.  It has a test import option&#8230;no more typing every question.  It also will randomize **everything**, including short answer questions!  It take some parameters for the questions (let x=1-1000) and it changes for **every student** on **every test**.  It really tests student&#8217;s ability to _use_ the information rather than try to remember the question from the last time they took the test.

The only thing that is daunting is that my school doesn&#8217;t have an on-site server&#8230;which means I get to learn about web hosting over the next few weeks as I try to figure this out.  I think I can sort through it, but if anyone happens to read this and knows how to perform an installation on a web host like GoDaddy or BlueHost, I would [love to talk some more](mailto:brian.bennett2@gmail.com).

More coming as I work though this&#8230;
