If you&#8217;re on the Internet frequently, you may have noticed a new phenomenon spreading across the tubes called the Harlem Shake. If you haven&#8217;t, well, you&#8217;re in for a treat. Take a look.



Crazy.

I can&#8217;t resist this kind of thing. So, I want to put together the first Internet Dance Party (from what I can tell, at least). It will take you 60 seconds of your time and the returns are enormous.

1. Go to this [YouTube video of the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV0LHCHf-pE). We only need the first 30 seconds.

2. Record yourself on your webcam (or other recording device) doing something normal. Typing, reading, grading&#8230;whatever, for 15 seconds.

3. When the beat drops at the 15 second mark, record yourself throwing down some sick [dances moves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vlkWUPhJCw). Costumes are encouraged.

4. Save your video and upload it to [this folder](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B7UphN8boIo2QnN1NUZuMmk2eFU/edit?usp=sharing).

5. Watch for the link with the finished video.

Thanks to [Jeremy Macdonald](http://www.twitter.com/mrmacnology) for introducing me to the Harlem Shake.
