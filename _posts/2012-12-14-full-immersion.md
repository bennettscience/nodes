My wife showed me this video the other night. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, consider taking thirty seconds to watch it. I&#8217;ll wait.

At the time, I was entertained. The ending really surprised me, and the video itself was engaging. But, as soon as it was over, I wasn&#8217;t thinking about buying a refrigerator or dishwasher any more than I had been before the clip.

How often are our classrooms like this? For me, I&#8217;m constantly asking myself whether or not a particular tool or activity is a gimmick (edutainment, if you will) or if it really has substance. There&#8217;s a very fine line between the two, and I&#8217;ve definitely been duped in the past. 

To determine if its going to make a long-lasting impact, I have to be able to connect it to the unit-at-large. How will the tool or activity come full circle from the initial hook? I think [Dan Meyer](http://www.twitter.com/ddmeyer) does this better than anyone I know with his [Three Act Math](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjIqyKM9d7ZYdEhtR3BJMmdBWnM2YWxWYVM1UWowTEE&output=html) website. He begins with a short video or image that prompts a question from the students. Teachers then work to scaffold through the questions to help students build meaning. I&#8217;m amazed at not only how thorough his work is, but also that he shares it for free. (For proof that these aren&#8217;t gimmicks, [check out Dan&#8217;s post](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=15873) from December 12.)

In science, I need to make the move to labs before instruction. [Terie Englebrecht](http://www.twitter.com/mrsebiology) wrote a short post earlier this week about how she&#8217;s moved to labs before instruction. Students move through the unit having been exposed to the &#8220;real&#8221; part of the content. I stink at this, and as I work on bring labs to the front of the cycle, I need to really make sure to build a program that feeds back on itself.

If you have ideas or suggestions on how to accomplish this, I&#8217;d love to hear about them.
