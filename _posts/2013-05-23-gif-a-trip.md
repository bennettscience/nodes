Last night, [I posted a photo set](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/riffing-10-steps-into-20-miles/) of images taken every mile for 20 miles. 

Today, they&#8217;re alive and in color. 

<div id="attachment_2130" style="max-width: 211px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/timelapse.gif"><img src="http://www.ohheybrian.com/images/timelapse.gif" alt="Central IL is pretty flat, so you can drive fast." width="201" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-2130" /></a>

This was the hardest GIF I&#8217;ve done to date. First, I imported everything into [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org) as layers. Then, I had to figure out how to create a GIF where only a pice of it was animated. After searching, going to Twitter, and searching some more, I came across [this tutorial](http://screencast.com/t/14ub10pfSl) from our very own [Jim Groom](http://www.twitter.com/jimgroom) did on how to animate just a portion of the frame. I had the right idea when I was working on it, but I didn&#8217;t know you had to _apply_ the layer mask.

Then, I went through each frame and lined it up with the rear-view mirror on the base image. There is still some wiggle in the top right corner and around the mirror, but I&#8217;m happy with how it came out, considering I may or may not have been driving while trying to snap the picture.

If you want to spruce it up or riff on it, <a href=http://www.brianbennett.org/gimp-files/timelapse.xcf">here&#8217;s the .xcf</a>
