As some of my followers noticed near the end of last week, I had a moment of weakness after my toughest class. I&#8217;ve been very frustrated with having to micromanage their learning using a flipped model, and it really has made me think hard. Long story short, I&#8217;m not giving up on a flipped class or a standards-based model, but I do need to make some major adjustments.

[Scott MacClintic](http://www.twitter.com/smacclintic) was great enough to take some of his afternoon to talk with me directly, and he strongly suggested that I read Daniel Pink&#8217;s [_Drive_](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318268555&sr=8-1) as it has to do with motivation in a variety of settings.

I bought the book that night.

I&#8217;m only about 1/3 of the way through right now, but I&#8217;ve learned some very important lessons already.

  1. I use too many &#8220;carrots and sticks&#8221; with my learners. I ask for creative, insightful work, but then I slap a grade on it, taking away all meaning of the work they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m trying to use bits and pieces from two conflicting worlds. No wonder I&#8217;ve been having problems.
  2. Grades and extra credit cannot be used to push learners forward. I find myself defaulting to the &#8220;you&#8217;re being graded on this&#8221; line to &#8220;motivate&#8221; my kids to do the work they&#8217;re supposed to be doing at the moment. Again, external pushing does not lead to higher thinking from learners. If they don&#8217;t see the value in it, why am I pushing it?
  3. Resist the urge to [tighten my grip](http://youtu.be/-wntX-a3jSY). I need to stop micromanaging the class and learn to co-manage with the learners. I want them to be self-directed, but I&#8217;m giving fewer and fewer opportunities rather than more and more. Learning from mistakes is important, but I need to give them chances to make mistakes in the first place.

  Again, I&#8217;m only 1/3 of the way through, but I need to make some major shifts if I want to achieve my goals. RSA animate did a good video on the gist of the book that you can see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">here.</a>

I&#8217;m sure this will be sparking more posts in the future.
