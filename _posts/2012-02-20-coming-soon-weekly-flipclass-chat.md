With the discussion about the Flipped Classroom gaining steam globally, I thought it was about time we begin to connect in real time.

I emailed [Jon](http://www.twitter.com/jonbergmann), [Aaron](http://www.twitter.com/chemicalsams), [Ramsey](http://www.twitter.com/ramusallam), [Dan](http://www.twitter.com/runfardvs), and Phil and we are excited to announce that **the first-ever FlipChat will be held on Monday, March 5 at 8PM EST.** 

We wanted to do this for a few reasons. First, the Flipped Classroom NING is a great way to connect with others, but it doesn&#8217;t facilitate whole-group discussion easily. Also, you need to wait between posting a question and hearing a response. Twitter will help alleviate that waiting period. Initial questions can be answered in real time, and then further discussion can continue on the NING in the following days.

Second, if you are on the fence about flipping, this is a chance to get real-life flipped class teacher advice or thoughts. We all know the process can be daunting, so this is your chance to connect and build a strong PLN centered on flipped classes.

Third, we all know there are common problems that arise in any flipped classroom. A Twitter chat will allow us to collaborate weekly on these issues and attempt to come to a group-informed decision on how to tackle these instructional goals.

Like I said before, we are _very_ excited to get this going. The collaboration has been great on the hashtag, so we&#8217;re excited to build on that momentum. Watch for updates on topics and resource links, and mark it on your calendar using the Google button below so you don&#8217;t forget!
