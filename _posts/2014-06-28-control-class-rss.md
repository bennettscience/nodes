A dangerous trend in education is the advent of the Learning Management System (LMS). [Jim Groom](http://www.twitter.com/jimgroom) writes about the danger of siloing our data across the web rather than sharing it freely. In other words, if you work in Edmodo, it&#8217;s difficult to share that content outside of Edmodo. It&#8217;s stuck and you&#8217;re robbed of the ability to share your work with a larger group who can build on, improve, and re-share.

The LMS has taken off because it takes the difficulty out of piecing things together. Unfortunately, rather than taking the time to look at alternatives, we go for the easy answer without considering the implications of locking out content until it&#8217;s almost too late.

[I&#8217;ve started a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hakCzhipFohT9XEcZGk0c85BqHnSdqTRUP2txUh5V8Y/edit?usp=sharing) which walks through how to connect documents, blogs, videos, and calendars all through RSS. Rather than locking your content away, RSS pulls from various sources &#8211; preferably ones you control &#8211; to deliver content directly to you or your students. RSS has been around for a long time, but it takes time to set up and manage, which is why most people pass over the option.

The goal of this document is to help you connect your dots. It&#8217;s growing and dynamic. I&#8217;ll update it, add, and take away. Feel free to copy it for yourself and share it with your colleagues. We need to begin talking about controlling our content and I think this is a great place to start.
