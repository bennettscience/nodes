Twitter mailase has set in big time. Twitter is dying! No, it&#8217;s just beginning!

* * *I&#8217;m not sure I can really explain my own confusion or mixed feelings. The power in any network is in how it allows you to connect with people. Part of the reason I&#8217;ve started to migrate away from Facebook is because of the backend filtering of which posts you see based on &#8220;engagement.&#8221; I have no control over that filtering, and it doesn&#8217;t sit well with me that I can&#8217;t change the way it works.</p> 

Twitter, on the other hand, shows everything. I can choose what to work with and what to ignore. I&#8217;ve gone through the stages, but now I&#8217;m trying to figure out what&#8217;s next.

Deep discussions happen. Off-the-cuff questions are answered rapidly. But I&#8217;m feeling a lack of connection. I feel a lack of purpose. I&#8217;m afraid that Twitter is become one of two things: A) A place teachers go because Twitter. B) A place where people talk all the time but don&#8217;t do anything different. Ideas stop when they hit your eyeballs. But, you can justify the time as &#8220;idea-searching.&#8221;

Maybe I&#8217;m following the wrong people, but it seems like a lot is put out by the bigfolk. I want to see new people, but how do we discover the new thinkers and leaders? I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of echo without much growth. And if that&#8217;s the case, it may be time to move on.

But where do we go?
