When I try new things, the fear really sets in as I&#8217;m giving instructions and trying to pick up on the nonverbal cues my students are sending me. Most days, they roll with it. Other days&#8230;well, there is usually some kind of course correction in there.

But it&#8217;s part of my practice now. Not crashing and burning of course; I learn a lot on those days, but I try not to make them the norm. My practice is to constantly as, &#8220;Can this be better?&#8221; Sometimes, the answer is &#8220;No, not right now,&#8221; and that&#8217;s totally okay. Other times, I&#8217;m actively trying to improve on a lesson, a task, or a supporting item.

Flipping is easy to jump into. Need to teach something? Find a video. Slap an EdPuzzle quiz on there and post it through Google Classroom. Students, turn in a one page summary of what you watched. Quiz on Friday.

Don&#8217;t keep your practice the same and call it flipped.

How are students engaging with the ideas? Not engaging with the _video_, but with the _idea_? The intangible? The abstract? The metaphorical? How are your students processing what you need them to learn in meaningful ways?

Flipping is really about a core change in practice that forces you, the teacher, to recognize that effective, deep learning requires our students chew on ideas&#8230;and not just gnaw, but really chew _hard_. Video might be a component of the chewing, but it can&#8217;t be the beginning and the end.

How do we avoid falling into a trap of simply adding another task to check off the list in the learning cycle? I have three main self-checks:

1. <u>Keep the video _thin_</u>. This is the first exposure, not the only (or even main) exposure. Some questions should be answered, but I really want to get students asking more questions. I try to ride the line of thorough instruction and full instruction.

2. <u>Explicitly connect ideas from the video to class.</u> I do this in a number of ways from a quick five-minute warm up at the start of class (&#8220;Remember, in the video&#8230;&#8221;) or in the video itself as a preview (&#8220;We&#8217;re going to do a lab where&#8230;&#8221;). I&#8217;ve found that these peeks help students make connections more readily as the learning tasks come around.

3. <u>Tell them the videos aren&#8217;t enough to get by on.</u> I don&#8217;t remember when this hit me, but I never really said that the video alone isn&#8217;t enough to help them learn. I make sure it&#8217;s very, very clear that they need to engage with me &#8211; and each other &#8211; during class to really excel. Video is a tool, not the solution.

In the long run, by downplaying the magic-ness of your videos and underlining the importance of multiple modes of engagement, your practice will begin to change. You&#8217;ll use that reclaimed time more effectively and you&#8217;ll find yourself starting to look critically at everything you do.
