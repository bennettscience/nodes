Today, I came to the realization that I&#8217;m approaching burnout, and that I need to do something to stay healthy for the break and the second semester.

I&#8217;ve also learned this year that I need a creative outlet to stay healthy, which is problem _numero uno_. I haven&#8217;t taken time to truly be creative since the summer. So, I&#8217;m turning my needs around to help push the creativity of my students. (I donâ€™t think this is unethical, but if you do, please let me know in the comments).

I have a split elective class: one half is working on web design, and the other is working on photo editing. Both groups are doing a similar assignment, pulled from the [Digital Storytelling: 106](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/storytelling-within-the-web/) archives. The web design side is hijacking the HTML of a website to tell a different story. The photo editing kids will be redesigning an existing website&#8217;s logo using GIMP. I will be doing both projects along with the kids so we can continue to learn together.

The final deadline is January 12, but I&#8217;ll begin posting finished assignments as they begin to roll in from the students. I&#8217;m hoping that as I dive into working with students, I&#8217;ll begin to feel a little more relaxed and less burnt out. If you have other ideas on how to beat burnout, I&#8217;d love to hear them in the comments.
