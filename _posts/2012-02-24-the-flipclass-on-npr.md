I was given a unique opportunity today to join our local NPR host on a show entitled _<a href="http://www.wnin.org/radio/the-trend" target="blank">The Trend</a>_. The first half of today&#8217;s show was about new classroom models popping up around the city and I was invited to represent the flipped classroom. Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity.

Erinn Jankowski and her co-teacher Heath Harrington run a pilot program called the Center for Community Outreach (CFCO).Â Their purpose is to have high school seniors working with local non-profit organizations on a wide variety of projects. It really is an amazing class and you can read about it here if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about it.

I was proud to represent the teachers that are working so hard to provide better education opportunities for students across the country. If you would like to hear more about the flipped class and Erinn&#8217;s CFCO, you can listen to the entire show online.
