I&#8217;ve written a lot lately about general chemistry, but I&#8217;m also using technology in my AP Chemistry class when I can work it in around all of the podcasting.  That isn&#8217;t a great excuse (I don&#8217;t even feel like that&#8217;s the right word) but the podcasting has definitely taken up most of my technology time.

Anyways, I decided to play Jeopardy with my AP Chemistry class this year.  Now, the funny thing is, none of them (well, very few) have never even seen the show&#8230;all they know about it is what their American or Canadian teachers say about it.  So, after I finished trying to explain the whole answer-in-the-form-of-a-question concept, we got going.  It went really well because I put together a hyperlinked PowerPoint presentation that linked each question value to the slide.  There was no back-and-forth, searching for the slide, etc.  I ended up liking it so much, I&#8217;m posting it here if you&#8217;re in need of a quick time-saver for a review game or for whatever else.  Just click and download the file.  The file is set up such that all you need to change are the category titles and then add-in your questions for the appropriate unit.

Right now, I only have single Jeopardy.  I&#8217;ll get a double template posted this week (hooray Thanksgiving) so if you&#8217;d like to do a double round, you don&#8217;t have to go through and change every single slide.

I hope some of you find this helpful&#8230;enjoy!
