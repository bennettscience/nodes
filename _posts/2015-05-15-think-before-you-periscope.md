[Bill Fitzgerald](http://www.twitter.com/funnymonkey) is someone you should follow on Twitter if you need help interpreting Terms of Service or Privacy Policies. He pays _real_ close attention to technology use in education, especially new, emerging tech.

Periscope is new and teachers love it. Show the Twitters all the great learning that&#8217;s happening _in real time???_ Definitely sounds like a good idea.

Please, read this.

Privacy is important stuff. You need to pay attention to how you&#8217;re sharing information about anyone, including yourself, _especially_ your students.
