I presented the flipped class and mastery learning models of instruction at the EARCOS Teacher&#8217;s Conference in Malaysia this past March. This is my first year using these methods, and honestly, I&#8217;ve been making a lot of it up as I go along. It&#8217;s worked out pretty well so far and students are engaged and learning every day.

The most questions I got at the conference had to do with documentation and grading, which makes sense. As I field more questions and have more opportunities to share these methods with other teachers, I&#8217;ve been missing subjectivity from my discussions, especially with exams and accommodating students with learning needs.

I am a firm believer that every student has the capacity to do great things&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t always show on tests.

An observation I&#8217;ve made throughout this year is that many students who do poorly on written exams can often sit and have a discussion with me about the content. They know what they&#8217;re talking about, they just have a hard time connecting the writing on a test to what they know. So, I began to give oral exams to those students. Their grades instantly jumped from _way_ below failing to right around the class average.

Because I knew my students, it was petty subjective. If they got one prompt from me, minus one point. Two prompts, two points, etc. I pulled the content from my chapter objectives they use to learn the content.

In an attempt to become more objective, I began to shift through volumes of rubrics on the internet&#8230;but I found most of them were for presentations or group projects and not for summative assessments. So, I sat down with our special ed coordinator and talked about oral exam rubrics and how to design an effective tool for summative assessment.

Let&#8217;s step up and not accept failure when simple accommodations can give every student an opportunity to succeed.
