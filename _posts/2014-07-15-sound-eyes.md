I read an article recently on the need for an &#8220;Instagram of Sound&#8221; &#8211; the idea being that I can record a short audio clip and then immediately share it to a network. After searching and searching, I couldn&#8217;t find the one I read, but there&#8217;s a good article on <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-case-for-an-instagram-of-sound" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Motherboard</a> which makes the case.

In the absence of such an app, I decided to try it with Instagram itself. I came up with a couple of rules:

  1. The video had to be still (or as little movement as possible)
  2. I couldn&#8217;t appear in the video
  3. The video had to be shot straight up &#8211; as if my phone was just watching from the table

I think it&#8217;s really interesting to think about how sound can communicate space, action, or surroundings. Our phones are with us everywhere&#8230;in reality, this is their experience. What do we miss if all we focus on is the visual? In fact, by playing videos on mute by default, I think Instagram is eroding the experience that sound can bring. I&#8217;m wondering if pushing the opposite direction will teach me something.

You can see the few I&#8217;ve done below, [follow me on Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/bennettscience), or search #soundaroundme through the app (their silly API doesn&#8217;t allow for web searches).
