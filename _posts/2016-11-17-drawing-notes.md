I used to make fill-in-the-blank notes for my students to complete while watching a video. For a particular subset of students, that works well. Helping lower the barrier for learning by providing a construct for information gathering led to more engagement when it came time to use the information.

Then I took on AP Biology.

Some very wise people told me to teach the material and not provide so much structure. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to put in the amount of time it would take to get everything pre-made. And boy, were they right. (I&#8217;ve taught AP Chem, but that was a long time ago. I needed their reminders.)

I&#8217;ve also wanted to move to a more free-form video&#8230;not as structured. More fluid. Focused more on deep content. Trying to write while I spoke at the same time was difficult to maintain. So, in response, I&#8217;ve moved to drawing out the lesson notes, scanning it, and talking over the pictures.

This has helped my students improve their _own_ visual representations of the concepts. It&#8217;s also helped me tell a better story (all science is a story anyways. Now it&#8217;s an illustrated story).

I sketch the notes&#8230;maybe 20 minutes to get everything sorted, and then scan it in to the computer. I drop the image into Camtasia and go for it.

Low key, but early indications are that it&#8217;s just as effective as fill in the blank. But now, students can fill in their own blanks.
