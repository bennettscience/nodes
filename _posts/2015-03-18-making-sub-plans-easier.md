I hate missing school. It&#8217;s stressful. I have to do multiple days worth of planning ahead of time, **plus** know what&#8217;s happening the day I get back. Then, I have to turn those plans into a written document that anyone in the world can follow to the letter.

It&#8217;s stressful.

I still leave a document with some specific notes for a substitute &#8211; things like management or specifics to take note of. But now, instead of writing out a ton of information on what to do, I record a simple video and post it to a static page on my class website. There are a couple little tricks I learned along the way:

**1. The page should be bare bones.** Don&#8217;t worry about making it &#8220;feel&#8221; like the rest of your class site. It should be something easy to display on a projector without having to hunt through menus to get the information. That also allows you to just replace the video and written instructions for the next time you&#8217;re out. Flexibility is key.

**2. Embed the video right in that page.** If you&#8217;re like me, you want to make sure that video is responsive, too. I found a [super-handy little snippet of CSS](http://avexdesigns.com/responsive-youtube-embed/) to make YouTube videos responsive, and I used that so students can access the information on their own later on any platform.</b>

**3. Keep your video unlisted so it stays within context.** I have a lot of content on YouTube, I want to keep the sub plans isolated because they don&#8217;t really fit in the flow of anything else there. This way, the video only &#8220;exists&#8221; when student need it &#8211; while I&#8217;m gone.

It&#8217;s not totally un-stressful now, but it&#8217;s way better than it used to be. If you&#8217;d like to [see my &#8220;away from school page,&#8221;](http://ohheybrian.com/absent/) or even [copy the source](view-source:http://ohheybrian.com/absent/) for your own page (self-hosted), that&#8217;d be dandy.
