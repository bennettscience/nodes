We&#8217;re using Canvas this year in our district and I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to actively (and successfully) utilize the Learning Mastery gradebook alongside the traditional gradebook&#8230;sort of a hybrid SBG.

I have Outcomes set for the entire year (the AP Bio curriculum) and I&#8217;m assigning Outcomes to each assignment. This is transferring nicely into the Learning Mastery gradebook. At the same time, coursework (labs, tests, etc) are being entered as normal assignments in the traditional gradebook. What I&#8217;m trying to figure out is how to weigh the Learning Mastery gradebook into the traditional.

Right now, as far as I can tell, you cannot have the Mastery gradebook results pushed directly into the traditional gradebook. So, I would have to copy each individual Outcome I&#8217;m assessing as an individual assignment in the course. I can do it, but it&#8217;s far from ideal.

I&#8217;m sure there are some of you out there who also use Canvas and hopefully, the Learning Mastery portion of the gradebook. What advice do you have? Any tips?
