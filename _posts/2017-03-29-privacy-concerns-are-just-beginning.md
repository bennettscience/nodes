[Bill Fitzgerald](http://www.twitter.com/funnymonkey) already wrote [an analysis of what can happen](https://funnymonkey.com/2017/isps-can-continue-to-collect-and-sell-all-of-our) now that Congress has [essentially erased privacy rules](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15080436/us-house-votes-to-let-isps-share-web-browsing-history) governing how Internet Service Providers can gather and sell your information indiscriminately, so I won&#8217;t get into that here.

If you&#8217;re in [#edtech](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23edtech), listen up:

## School data can now be used by the service provider to gather student information without notification and used for whatever they want.

&#8212;

We are not immune.

If your school gets eRate funding, you are now likely to be in breach of data security rules because the ISP itself &#8211; not the app or website you&#8217;re using &#8211; is collecting and can, potentially, make money off of student information. Moreso, the FCC is in charge of eRate and Ajit Pai, the Republican chair, [has promised to roll back net neutrality and privacy rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/trumps-fcc-quickly-targets-net-neutrality-rules.html) set in place by the former chair, Tom Wheeler.

This is a big deal.

I was calling my representatives to ask that they vote against this rule. Now, I&#8217;m calling to ask them to think about the monetization that is going to occur through our student&#8217;s use of the web and how they plan on mitigating the legal issues now in play just because a school offers Internet access.

**This is a big deal.**

Call your representatives. Stand up for reasonable restrictions on data collection and use by service providers.
