[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/13524378@N03/2397881577)I&#8217;m going to take a hiatus from Twitter.

I love sharing learning with my network. Lately, Twitter has become somewhat of a frustration for me. Being involved is great, but I think it also narrows my vision and I begin to focus on fitting a particular mold or norm based on what my network is doing at the time rather than trusting my own decision making and direction.

In all honesty, some of this has to do with a lot of the discussion surrounding Flipped Learning. With so many ideas, arguments, and questions flying around, I feel like I need to take some time and personally reassess what I do daily in my room. I need a working definition, and to do that, I need time to myself.

I will still be writing email and possibly a blog post, so you can still get in touch with me. But as for Twitter, we&#8217;ll talk later.
