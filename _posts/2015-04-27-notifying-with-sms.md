I meant to grab a bag of stuff for school this morning on my way out the door. Turns out at 5:45 in the morning, you don&#8217;t remember to grab things off the counter (thankfully, I don&#8217;t need that stuff until tomorrow). I don&#8217;t like to-do list apps (prefer pen and paper), and my phone is on silent each morning until I get to school.

I hate notifications anyways, which is why I turned everything off other than phone calls and text messages. I still get calendar reminders (out of absolute necessity) but even then, I tend to close those without thinking too much about actually _remembering_ to do something.

Texts, though, are a different story. I pay attention to them. When someone sends a text, it has my attention.

So, rather than rely on a to-do list or plain calendar reminders to do something, I&#8217;m routing those through IFTTT to send myself a text.

To do this, log into IFTTT and create a new recipe using Google Calendar as the trigger. In step 2, be sure to choose &#8220;Event from search starts&#8221; as the trigger. Otherwise, any time you add an event, you&#8217;re going to get a text message, which isn&#8217;t cool.

Then, pick a keyword &#8211; I used &#8220;reminder&#8221; &#8211; to search for. It has to be in the title or the event description to fire correctly. So, for me, my calendar event would be: &#8220;Reminder &#8211; get groceries.&#8221; Then, set the time to when you actually want to _do_ whatever it is you need to do. Again, mine is around dinner tonight because I&#8217;ll be near the kitchen and can do it quickly.

Set the SMS channel as the action (make sure your phone number is correct!) and heypresto, you have a SMS-enabled text reminder system for those little things you tend to forget.

Again, I know that this can be done just using the calendar notifications. But, if you&#8217;re like me, and hate those, you can use this instead. Also remember this works with _any_ phone, not just smartphones. So, if you revert (like I&#8217;ve also considered) you can have the benefits of notifications when and where you need them on any platform.
