People say life gets more complicated as you get bigger. Well, I&#8217;m at 42, and I couldn&#8217;t disagree more.

I might not be as quick or nimble as the 19&#8217;s, but I sure am a heck of a lot more agile than the 52&#8217;s or even the 48&#8217;s. Admittedly, I don&#8217;t get out more than once a week or so, but when I do, I can get the job done. I mean, why go out if you&#8217;re not going to make a big difference? Seems like a waste of time and energy to me.

Anyways, why is life less complicated? Well, for starters, I have an established routine. When I go out, I know exactly where I need to go, and what I need to do, and pretty much how long it&#8217;ll take me to do it. There isn&#8217;t much variation, really&#8230;I just try and make sure I don&#8217;t hit any rough patches along the way. I haven&#8217;t changed my habits for years. If it ain&#8217;t broke, why fix it?

Sure, I can&#8217;t always see too well, being 42 and all, but, I usually manage well enough. I&#8217;ve been doing this work for a long time, so I can adjust on the fly without too much trouble. Sometimes, it can also get a little bumpy out there, but, that&#8217;s just the way it goes. I roll with it. I may be at 42, but I&#8217;m still solid as a rock when I need to be.

I enjoy the patterns. I enjoy the predictability. I enjoy seeing the line ahead of me, and the change that is left behind after I pass. There&#8217;s no guesswork, so I can let my mind wander and just do what needs to be done. I guess if I really think about it, 19&#8217;s _could_ do the same work, but it would be nearly as efficient. I&#8217;m proud of that.

When I&#8217;m not working, I can rest assured that I&#8217;ll be needed again. I&#8217;m always needed, which is comforting. I don&#8217;t have to worry about becoming irrelevant any time soon. I&#8217;m patient and I&#8217;ll be here, ready to go.

Life as a &#8220;42-er&#8221; is great.
