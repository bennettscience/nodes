</div>In a spinoff from the

[Colorize It](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/colorize-it/) and [Focus on One Color](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/focus-on-one-color/), I took a photo of my desk at home and then colorized some of my favorite things that surround me each day.

This also makes me think about how much junk I have on my desk. Maybe it&#8217;s time to make some strategic decisions and cut down on stuff I haven&#8217;t looked at it too long.

I did this pretty quickly in GIMP. I took the photo, duplicated the original and made the copied layer monochrome. Then, I applied a white layer mask and used the free select tool to get nice, crisp lines. I then filled those spaces with black to erase the mask and let the colors show through.

The thumbnail will take you to the full-res photo.
