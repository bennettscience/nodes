The eight weeks of remixing have kicked off for CEP811 at MSU. Right off the bat, our first task was to pick an edtech buzzword and use Mozilla&#8217;s Popcorn Maker (I think they should have called it &#8220;remixerator,&#8221; but that&#8217;s just me) to make a one-minute video explaining our buzzword.

How could I resist the opportunity to describe a MOOC? (I really just like saying the word &#8220;MOOC.&#8221; Admit it. You do too.)

Here&#8217;s my final remix:



I&#8217;d never used [Popcorn](http://popcorn.webmaker.org) before and it actually took me a good while to get used to it. I&#8217;ve done a lot of video editing, so it was hard for me to not treat it like a full-blown video editor. I actually started this on Tuesday and then had to walk away for a little while to try and clear my head before I finished.

I think what I like the most is being able to search for content as well as link to content right in the media bin. It&#8217;s helpful to be able to paste a link and have the photo or GIF pop right in. I also like that links are included in the live project for attribution. It makes the whole curation process much simpler because I don&#8217;t have to try and keep track of every source in a separate space. I really tried to come up with metaphors for some of these ideas, but being limited to Creative Commons materials (and I&#8217;m not complaining) makes it hard to do sometimes.

I couldn&#8217;t help but editorialize a little bit at the end. MOOCs aren&#8217;t that hard to understand: they&#8217;re super-massive classes taught by a professor (_usually_ using traditional means) to students in an LMS. There is little creativity and little freedom to really use the web. Essentially, they&#8217;re not doing a whole lot of innovative work, and now, [some are making a ton of money off of their platforms](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2013/07/10/coursera-hits-4-million-students-and-triples-its-funding/).

Of course, the big conflict is that universities also want to make money off of these online courses. So, already, we have a conflict of interests that doesn&#8217;t really do anything to help students have a better online learning experience.

It may be summed up best by Larry Cuban in [a recent Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/07/08/why-moocs-wont-revolutionize-higher-ed/):

> Given the history of universities and colleges in the United States, chances are that many higher education institutions (non-elite and community colleges) will continue to retrofit and transform MOOCs into credit-bearing courses that will yield revenue. MOOCs will not revolutionize higher education.

Are MOOCs here to stay? I&#8217;m not putting my money on it.
