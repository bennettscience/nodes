Since April 18th, I have been sending out job applications all over the midwest.  Few options were panning out as July rolled around.  I was starting to get extremely nervous about the coming school year and if I would even be teaching this fall.

I got an e mail from <a href="http://educationdreamer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Brett Clark</a> (twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Mr_Brett_Clark" target="_blank">@Mr_Brett_Clark</a>) asking if I would Skype in to a webinar with <a href="http://mast.unco.edu/programs/vodcasting/" target="_blank">Jonathan Bergmann</a> about the Flipped Classroom.  Of course, I&#8217;m always looking for ways to talk to teachers interested in using a flipped approach, so I readily took the offer.  As I was talking with Brett and Jon about the webinar, I mentioned that I was looking for work.  Jon had already been a huge help to me, sending my name out to his contacts, and Brett was eager to help as well.  His district also happened to have a couple of science openings available, so he got in touch with those principals and they ended up sitting in on the webinar session.

Long story short, after the presentation, I had an interview with the principal and a job offer that night to teach biology.  I&#8217;ve just accepted the position and I&#8217;ll be the new biology teacher at <a href="http://www.evscschools.com/AdminDefault.aspx?PortalId=2ad66c19-3c16-4cd6-af3d-149279ec36d0" target="_blank">Harrison High School</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Evansville,+IN&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.879582,87.539063&z=12" target="_blank">Evansville, IN</a>.

As I was talking with the principal, she really stressed that I was hired to help push the science department with technology use and designing meaningful, technology-integrating instruction.  I&#8217;m extremely excited about not only having a job come August, but also having the freedom to continue what I&#8217;ve done in the last year and the freedom to refine and push the flipped classroom strategy.  Now that I&#8217;m teaching biology, I&#8217;m excited to begin to move away from the videos and more into guided inquiry, POGIL, and other tools that can be used in a flipped setting.

Thank you so much to everyone that has helped in my job search.  It wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without people taking time to send my name around and to send names to me.  Its just another example of how having a PLN can really come through when you need it.
