Today is the last day of our family of two. This weekend, my daughter will be born.

* * *

My wife is 39 weeks pregnant today. We&#8217;ve been busily preparing our home for the arrival of our daughter, who happens to be the first girl born in _either_ family since Lindsey. We&#8217;ve been blessed with support from our families and we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do [nearly as much as we have](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/in-absentia) in the time we were given.

How do I know my daughter will be born today? Because if Lindsey doesn&#8217;t go into labor by tonight, we will go to the hospital and be induced.

I&#8217;m in a weird place right now. This was not the plan. Everything has gone so well over the last 39 weeks, it feels almost like we&#8217;re [dropping the ball at the goal line](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap2000000239022/Drop-six).

There are mental positives and negatives to this whole arrangement. **Pro**: I don&#8217;t have to anticipate waking up in the middle of the night to my wife&#8217;s contractions. **Con**: I have to think about the induction and possible cascading effects all day. It&#8217;s hard not to think about the negative impacts of medically inducing labor when you&#8217;re staring it in the face.

I trust our doctor. I trust his judgement and wisdom. I trust his staff, who alerted us to the fact that Lindsey&#8217;s amniotic fluid is lower than it should be. But I also trust that God has arranged all of our meetings, relationships, and circumstances with our best interests in mind. While this isn&#8217;t the path we were hoping to take, it doesn&#8217;t matter what we had in mind. All that matters is the fact that Lindsey delivers the baby safely, and that we can all come home together.

We&#8217;ve been prepared and we&#8217;ll continue to be equipped. We&#8217;re ready for two to become three.
