I asked my students on the last day of school to write letters to next year&#8217;s students, whoever they are. I took all of those responses, removed the common words, and then pasted all of the letters into Wordle.

The assignment was: &#8220;Write a letter explaining how a future student can be successful in a flipped classroom.&#8221;

So, are videos still the most important part?
