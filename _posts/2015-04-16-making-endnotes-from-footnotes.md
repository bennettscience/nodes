\*\*Update 12.22.2016\*\* Since this has become quite a popular script, I&#8217;ve converted it into a Google Docs Add On so it can be used across documents. Check out \[the blog post\](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/2016/12/introducing-endnote-generator-add-on/) or the \[Endnote Generator website\](http://dev.ohheybrian.com/endnotes) for more information.

\*\*Update 8.27.2016\*\* As Phil noted in the comments, the script didn&#8217;t format anything over two digits in length. That has been \[corrected in the source\](https://github.com/bennettscience/footToEnd). If you need more (100+ endnotes may be too many, though&#8230;) leave a comment and I&#8217;ll go back and make the changes.

[Krissy Venosdale](http://www.twitter.com/veinspired) asked on Tuesday if there was a way to make endnotes in Google Docs as easily as footnotes. I thought, &#8220;Surely there is.&#8221; 

Well, there&#8217;s not. 

So I wrote a script that does it.

[It&#8217;s hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/bennettscience/footToEnd) along with instructions on how to install the script (it&#8217;s **not** an add-on&#8230;just a custom script) and run it in your document.

Here&#8217;s a peek:

When you add the script to the document (manual process right now &#8211; [read the instructions](http://github.com/bennettscience/footToEnd)) it adds a custom menu from which you run the script.

I know endnotes and footnotes aren&#8217;t really used in high school, but if you&#8217;re writing a book or something&#8230;maybe it&#8217;ll be helpful to you.

Either way, it was fun to write and it works pretty quickly. I haven&#8217;t tested it with documents more than a few pages long, so if you&#8217;re going to try it on something major, I&#8217;d suggest making a duplicate copy to run it on first, just in case.

I&#8217;m a teacher by day, after all.
