My computer is getting pretty full of photos. I&#8217;ve been taking more, but it is also housing nearly every photo taken since my wedding in 2009. I know that is chump change to a lot of people, but it&#8217;s been bugging me.

I was going back through some of my [kitchen remodel photos](http://flic.kr/s/aHsjFvccwM) from earlier this spring and&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how I missed it, but some _random_ guy is dancing in my back yard in one of them. I have **no** idea who it is. I also don&#8217;t know how the hell I missed it the first time through these photos.

<div style="max-width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://ohheybrian.com/images/jimdancing.gif"><img src="http://ohheybrian.com/images/jimdancing.gif" width="650" height="867" class /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Who the hell is that guy?
  </p>
</div>

I haven&#8217;t finished going through my pictures, and I haven&#8217;t seen him since the tear out day back in May. But since seeing&#8230;whatever it is&#8230;I&#8217;m worried about walking past that window alone at night.

&#8212;
  
This assignment was tough because I needed to find a way to keep my image small (original is over 2400 x 3200, and over 2MB) and make sure Jim stayed outside. So, I converted my image to 64 bit and resized it to 650px tall (173KB final size, with all the layers). That dramatically changed the file size, which was awesome. To get Jim outside, I imported the [modified GIF](http://iamtalkytina.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jim_groom_dance_MOD.gif) as frames (thanks [Talky Tina](http://iamtalkytina.com/2013/08/august-2013-gif-challenge-2-dancing-jim-all-over-the-world/)) and then cropped, scaled, and positioned. I merged Jim with the background image.

To get the window frame, I used the lasso select to pull the glass part, being careful to cut around objects on the window sill to keep some depth perspective. Then, it was a matter of duplicating this cut window frame and merging it into each later of the project to sit on top of Jim.

I had tried to do this back during the summer #ds106zone sequence, but couldn&#8217;t figure it out or something. I don&#8217;t remember.
