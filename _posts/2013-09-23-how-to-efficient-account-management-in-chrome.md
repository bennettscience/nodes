This post has been on the back burner for a long time, but I _finally_ have a little time to sit down and finish it.

I use Chrome exclusively. There are a few little hiccups (like Java plugins not running, but really, in the age of HTML5, who uses Java plugins? Get with it, people.) but for the most part, Chrome is the most reliable and most customizable browser available.

One thing I really struggled with was having multiple Google accounts. I have my personal account, but I also had one for work. If you&#8217;re in a GAFE school, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. It really drove me nuts when I would click on a document link only to have it open in the wrong account.

I&#8217;ve discovered a really interesting little tidbit about Chrome that has changed my life forever. Chrome does this neat thing called &#8220;sandboxing.&#8221; Essentially, what happens in one tab doesn&#8217;t affect what happens in another. The same is true for one Chrome window in relation to another. This is the key.

So, to manage your Google life like a boss, you need to do a couple things. First, go into your **Chrome settings**.

Now, find the part on the page that says **Users**.

Then, click on **Add new user**. Once you name the user (and choose a sweet avatar) you&#8217;ll get a sign in page.

This sign in page is where you choose which account you want to use for this particular user. So, I have a **personal** user as well as a **work** user. Each user is linked to that specific Google account. So, I don&#8217;t have to deal with the annoying &#8220;multiple sign in&#8221; option any more. 

The other awesome thing about this method is that all of your apps and extensions are kept separate (which makes sense, because they&#8217;re linked to accounts). I can have extensions associated with my personal Google account (RSS reader, calendar, etc) as well as extensions for my work account. The same is true for passwords, forms&#8230;you name it.

If you&#8217;re a Chrome user, this is definitely the most efficient I&#8217;ve ever been with the web. I do have to keep two windows open at times, but the amount of time that is saved from not having to sign in and out of accounts has been well worth a slightly more cluttered desktop.

Do you have any other Chrome power user tips? Leave them in the comments.
