I had the chance to attend MACUL&#8217;s (Michigan Association for Computer Users in Learning) 2013 conference held in Detroit this past week. I have a lot of good friends living in Michigan, and after a year of pestering and reminders, I finally made it up there. Let me just say, Michigan has one of the strongest education presences at a grassroots level that I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Over 4,000 educators from across the spectrum descended on Detroit&#8217;s Cobo Center and some great things happened.

I wrote a [post nearly a year ago](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/redesigning-learning-in-a-flipped-classroom/) observing that with content available all the time, we really need to think about how we structure our current learning spaces. I turned that blog post into a presentation at MACUL on Thursday. You can watch the recording below or on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/WNzyZJmNMP0). It runs about 30 minutes, so if you can&#8217;t spend that long watching it, I&#8217;ve posted a .mp3 you can download and put on your iPod for later. To save it, right click on the play button and select &#8220;Save video as&#8230;&#8221;



On Friday, I gave a Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts session for people who are interested in Flipped Learning, but don&#8217;t really know where to begin the process. This session was a lot of fun, and we had some great discussion on each point about why it is labeled as a Do or a Don&#8217;t. This one runs about 50 minutes, so I have it as an mp3 for now. I&#8217;ll update this post with a YouTube link when it&#8217;s ready to be viewed.
