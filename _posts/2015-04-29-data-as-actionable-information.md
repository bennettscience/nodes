Continuing on my data-trends this week, I&#8217;ve realized (consciously, at least) that when quantitative data is shown to students, it&#8217;s a report of some kind: a report card, a progress report, test scores, etc. It&#8217;s all final information &#8211; it isn&#8217;t actionable.

Yesterday, we played a review game where students submitted answers to a Google form which then spit out a grade based on those submissions. The purpose was to get them thinking about the information and to give them some immediate feedback &#8211; as a class &#8211; on how they did.

Seeing the gauges along with their place against _all_ reported classes helped visualize where they fell on a preparedness scale in context.

It also helped the class see what _specific_ standards they needed to go back and look over. I didn&#8217;t want individual information for this activity because the goal was generalize, _actionable_ information.

[Michael Pershan](http://www.twitter.com/mpershan) prompted my thinking this morning with his video (and comments) entitled, &#8220;[Why Our Hints Don&#8217;t Help](http://www.shadowmathcon.com/michael-pershan/).&#8221; It&#8217;s extremely insightful (go take a look) and really helped me think through how I talk about quantitative information. It should be a call to action, not just a report.

It also changes the way students see these scores. They aren&#8217;t final any more &#8211; it&#8217;s a spot check on their progress. It&#8217;s a reality check for their perception of how well they have learned the information. It also leads to more good questions like, &#8220;Where can we find more information on [X]?&#8221; It&#8217;s a visual prompt, more than anything, which helps set the course for subsequent learning.
