No, not that Mars.

* * *

[FlipCon14](http://flippedlearning.org/domain/18) is coming up June 23-25. This is the 7th annual event, and I&#8217;ve had the privilege of watching it grow from 35 people in Woodland Park (FlipCon10) to nearly 450 last year in Minnesota. This year, we&#8217;re in Mars, PA (near Pittsburgh) and we&#8217;ve got a fantastic lineup planned. Along with Jon and Aaron&#8217;s keynote, Molly Schroeder will be opening the conference with her _Living in Beta_ keynote.

If you&#8217;re on the fence about coming, [we have the full schedule](https://events-na11.adobeconnect.com/content/connect/c1/1126390531/en/events/event/shared/1149740303/event_landing.html?sco-id=1148362658&_charset_=utf-8) &#8211; including all concurrent sessions &#8211; posted online for review. Hopefully, that will help tip you over the edge. 

I can honestly say that this conference kicked off my interest in improving digital teaching and learning. Each year, I learn more about what teachers are doing to help students and how I can adapt some of the things they do to my own practice. I&#8217;m excited to see old friends, and meet new ones. If you&#8217;re also planning on heading to Pittsburgh, leave a shout out in the comments.
