[I saw a post](http://cogdogblog.com/2013/02/13/valentine-moment/) from [Alan Levine](http://www.twitter.com/cogdog) this morning that connected back to an [old DS106 assignment](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/valentines-day-caption-challenge/). I&#8217;ve started dabbling in the 106 community this year, so I decided to give this one a crack. The assignment was to use a painted romance novel cover and overlay some text, making one of the creepiest Valentine&#8217;s Day cards ever. Here&#8217;s what I came up with:

Weird, huh? To do this, I downloaded a photo from the [public Flickr folder](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cali4beach/sets/72157625927476289/with/6877278725/) and then imported the image into Snagit. Then, because I&#8217;m very happily married, I [Googled some pickup lines](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=cheesy+pickup+lines). I chose one of the creepier lines I found and then used the text tool to overlay the quote and export as a new image.

Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day.
