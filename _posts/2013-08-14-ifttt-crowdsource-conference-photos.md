A year ago, I discovered [If This Then That (IFTTT)](http://www.ifttt.com), which might be one of the most innovated web services I&#8217;ve ever come across. Ever.

In short, it allows you to create simple programs that help manage things you do on the web. If you use the Internet a lot, you should use IFTTT. Like, today.

I started with some simple scripts to do things like [auto-tweet new blog posts](https://ifttt.com/recipes/111121) and [tweet new YouTube uploads](https://ifttt.com/recipes/111122) (a lot of stuff to do with tweeting, actually&#8230;).

As I played with it more, I got crazier ideas. For instance, I travel for work. If I drive my car, I can deduct the mileage from my taxes each spring. But, the IRS wants me to have proof of that mileage. Now, I could keep track of receipts, but that&#8217;s a little insane. I do have invoices, but I wanted one more level of tracking. Well, I created an IFTT recipe that will add my location (through Foursquare) to my Google Calendar when I use a certain tag with my check-in. You can grab it [here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/94810).

Now, I&#8217;m trying to think of ways I can use it to share out what teachers and students are doing. For instance, I had an idea yesterday on ways to crowdsource photos from a conference. It takes some creative thinking around Gmail and a Flickr or Instagram account, but it can be done. 

If you&#8217;re interested in using this recipe, you can [grab it here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/111125), but there are instructions below.

  1. **Set up a Gmail filter** &#8211; There&#8217;s a good tutorial with a video [here](http://www.googlegooru.com/how-to-create-a-gmail-filter/) if you don&#8217;t know how to do this. The important thing is to make sure the filter is easy to manage in whatever account you&#8217;re using. A good way to manage it is to make the filter the name of the conference (or the Twitter hashtag you&#8217;re using).
  2. **Make sure your attendees use that filter** &#8211; IFTTT looks for that Gmail filter, so if the email isn&#8217;t grabbed by Gmail, their photo won&#8217;t make it to Flickr. I make sure they do this by making the subject line of the email the conference hashtag.
  3. **Tagging on Flickr** &#8211; The script is set to tag the photos with the name of the conference. This will help you manage those photos later if you want to add them to a set or group. I would keep that, but you can add more if you want to.
  4. **Make sure people know about it!** &#8211; Be sure to tell your attendees that all they have to do is email you a photo, and it will get posted automatically.

I&#8217;m looking for a way to get Twitter photo uploads to go to Flickr, but because you can&#8217;t use Twitter as an input anymore, that&#8217;s becoming a little more complicated. If you want people to use Instagram, you can create a similar recipe that looks for an Instagram tag and it will send those to Flickr for management later. I chose email because there are still a lot of people that aren&#8217;t on Twitter or Instagram, but use email. Seemed like a low barrier for entry.
