I&#8217;m traveling today and tomorrow to lead some training on Flipped Learning and let&#8217;s just say it hasn&#8217;t been the smoothest trip so far.

First, I thought (my own fault, btw) we were doing Mac training. Turns out, we&#8217;re doing PC. So, I partitioned my hard drive and managed to get Windows installed before I left.

Second, I&#8217;m tearing out my kitchen this weekend to begin a big remodel. So, while I was packing to leave, I was also trying to straighten out my junk so my pregnant wife didn&#8217;t have to do it all on her own. Oh, I forgot to mention that my entire family is coming to help. I love them all dearly, but its going to be a packed house for a couple days.

All of which brings me to my third point: in my haste to leave, I left my computer&#8217;s power cord at home. Ugh. Rookie mistake.

I got down to the very cozy bed and breakfast that was arranged for me, and I began thinking about how I could keep up with my #ds106 work for this week using only mobile apps. Thankfully, [Ben Rimes](http://www.twitter.com/techsavvyed), [Jim Groom](http://www.twitter.com/jimgroom), and [Scott Lo](http://www.twitter.com/scottlo) came to my rescue. This network really is amazing. Everyone is extremely encouraging and eager to help. I&#8217;m loving my experience so far.

Anyways, I opened up [SketchBook Express](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=sketchbook%20express&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDAQFjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fsketchbook-express-for-ipad%2Fid410871280%3Fmt%3D8&ei=cD6cUcK4IYfw8QST5oCIDQ&usg=AFQjCNGOCs5oCUvmr6HZm7-6lv6TRtCjMw&bvm=bv.46751780,d.eWU), which is the mobile version of the [SketchBook](http://www.autodesk.com/products/sketchbook-pro) platform for OSX. It&#8217;s a pretty powerful drawing program which gives you all kinds of different brushes and tools as well as layer editing. Exactly what I needed. I decided to take a stab at the [&#8220;Looking at Yourself&#8221;](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/looking-at-yourself/) assignment because it would give me a chance to play with the app a little more.

Dang, I love it.

As always, the photo is free to use.

I was able to create the image using a previous shot from the camera roll and layering a quick screenshot on top. All of the editing, including the trimming, positioning, layering, and transparency were done in the app. It&#8217;s free, and definitely worth downloading.

I&#8217;m wondering if I should try and do as many assignments as I can using mobile only. As a former teacher, I&#8217;m a big believer that mobile is going to be the new normal in schools, and having a broad range of experience creating on mobile might be useful in the future.

Anyways, just some things to chew on. Now, I&#8217;m finally going to get some sleep.
