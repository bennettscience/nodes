Trying to represent a familiar object in abstract ways is harder than you&#8217;d think. The goal of this particular assignment was to take three photos of an everyday &#8220;thing&#8221; and see if someone could figure out what it is. <del>Rather than just posting a gallery, I wanted to have some more fun. As you scroll to each box (go slowly!) a picture will be revealed one at a time.</del> Can you guess the object in one? Two? Or will you need all three?

How many clues did it take you?
