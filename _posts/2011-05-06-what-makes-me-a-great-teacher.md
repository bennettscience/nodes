Ok, so the title is a little self-indulgent, but don&#8217;t judge me just yet.

I was thinking back about student teaching earlier this week and how my cooperating teacher made me reflect on _everything_ and how I got so tired of it by the end of student teaching. She was constantly pushing me to reflect in writing on every single lesson I taught, which was significant in and of itself. What made this really special to me was the fact that she _always_ made me take the time to identify <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strengths before weaknesses</span>.

It seems like a little thing, but how often do we sit down after a lesson and immediately think of the things that went well? If you&#8217;re like me, probably not very often. I&#8217;m usually thinking about what didn&#8217;t go well before the lesson is even over. I don&#8217;t usually take the time to think and reflect about what made a lesson or unit succeed. Hence, the title.

I know teachers can be afraid to affirm too much for fear of a &#8220;feel-good&#8221; class where students don&#8217;t need to face reality. That&#8217;s not the point of this. The whole idea is to take some time and identify what things you are doing on a daily basis that probably go unnoticed, but really impact your teaching and your drive to become a better professional. These are my top three:

  1. I talk to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every</span> student <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every</span> day.
  2. I take time to reflect and make notes on each unit I teach.
  3. I ask other people for help when I know I&#8217;m in a jam or when I could do something better.

It isn&#8217;t vain or conceited to say these things make me a great teacher.  I am not saying I&#8217;ve reached my pinnacle&#8230;these are things I did well this year and things I hope to continue to do well.

I suggest you take some time to think about things you do that make you a great teacher.  I&#8217;d love to see some thoughts in the comments.
