State testing. There are no words.

Week two of six is halfway done. Meanwhile, I keep teaching and I keep assessing. Most of it is formative, informing the learning process and my instructional cycle. Looping back to rehash ideas that are still elusive; being transparent about why we&#8217;re doing what.

Yes, there is still a need for demonstration of learning. 

\_Yes, you have to take this test today. Show me what you know.\_

There comes a point where I feel like I&#8217;m just chasing shadows to justify my own work.
