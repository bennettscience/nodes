How much money do we spend to go to conferences? A few hundred, easily. 

How much money do we spend on tools, apps, programs, and resources to use in our classroom?

Or better yet, how many people show up for sessions which talk about programs you can buy to use with your kids in the classroom?

It&#8217;s strange that we put so much out there to travel and hear about tools, but all we want to hear about is the free stuff.
