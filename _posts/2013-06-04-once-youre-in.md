&#8230;there&#8217;s no escape.

I wanted to catch up on assignments for [the ds106zone](http://www.ds106.us), so I hopped in on this week&#8217;s audio work. An easy one to get in was create a radio bumper for the [ds106radio](http://ds106rad.io/listen/) channel using a short clip from The Twilight Zone.

I deviated a little from this week&#8217;s episodes by watching [Five Characters in Search of an Exit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Characters_in_Search_of_an_Exit), and it struck me as a great parallel for my foray into ds106. I&#8217;ve dabbled, I&#8217;ve asked questions, and I&#8217;ve explored. Now that I&#8217;m _fully_ into the fold, I don&#8217;t think I can ever leave. The community is fantastic, and even though I haven&#8217;t kept up with the &#8220;official&#8221; class, I feel more creative accomplishment than I have in a long time.

For kicks, I also decided to throw together a very simple Twilight Zone themed radio banner. Maybe I&#8217;ll GIF it. Maybe not. If you want to remix it, you can grab the .xcf and have at it.

Now, I just need to listen to the radio show constantly to see if [ScottLo](http://www.twitter.com/scottlo) decides to use it&#8230;
