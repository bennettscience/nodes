I&#8217;m not going to lie &#8211; I found this week&#8217;s assignment really, _really_ difficult. More on that later.

Nearly all of the coding I&#8217;ve done has been in front-end web development. I like playing with HTML structure and seeing what I can do with CSS. Lately, I&#8217;ve been creating a blog template which added some significant PHP and jQuery. I enjoy working in text editors, the command line, and the development tools in Chrome. I like text.

Scratch is the complete opposite. Everything you do is represented with graphics. Loops are large brackets which take blocks of code, operators modify events as different shapes&#8230;I didn&#8217;t find it very intuitive, to be completely honest. I spent most of my time trying to remember which color corresponded with which shape so I could get into the correct menu. There was a lot of clicking, a lot of eye rubbing, and more than one trip away from the computer to clear my head.

The entire process of programming in Scratch is rooted in abstraction and decomposition. I know what actions I want the sprite to make, but in order to get that to happen, I need to think through each and every step leading up to the result. Once I had an idea of what steps needed to be accomplished, it was time to put them into sequence and think about how to chunk the project up.

I started with a small drawing program. It isn&#8217;t very advanced&#8230;but it took me a while to get through because I had to think through each block and what it was doing step by step.



After adding each command, I would test the program&#8230;then debug. Rinse. Wash. Repeat.

It still amazes me how much the final product changes from the initial idea. At first, I wanted the sprite to jump around the page, drawing random lines to see what could be generated by chance alone. That isn&#8217;t much fun for the user, so I moved it to a follow-the-mouse game. A concept I remember from my art classes is continuous-line drawing, where you draw without lifting the tip of the pencil. I always enjoyed that style, so I decided to put it into a little game you can play.

Now that I have some chops, I went back to the game-of-chance idea. This game is based on luck alone, and it came from the &#8220;do something surprising&#8221; prompt in the Creative Computing handbook.



This project threw a new loop at me (get it? loop?) and I _really_ struggled with writing separate scripts for each individual sprite in the editor. I expected one main editing interface, and was really confused about where my scripts would go as I added sprites and backdrops. Again, I think this goes back to my experience with written code and managing everything in the flow of one document. (If you&#8217;re curious, this is called &#8220;object-oriented programming,&#8221; something I&#8217;m familiar with, but not nearly competent in.) So, this exercise turned into a major learning experience for me.

I found myself &#8211; again &#8211; digging through, step by step, experimenting and testing, until I found patterns that I could build off of. 

> It&#8217;s important to remember that Computational Thinking is all about the problem-solving process.

I was sketching diagrams, talking out loud, and looking at other examples as I figured out where I was failing. The great thing about computers is that we can rapidly implement ideas and iterate toward a working solution&#8230;they help us quickly isolate problems and work toward solutions. So, the computer is extending not only our creative capabilities, it&#8217;s helping us refine those ideas in an efficient way. 

We can emulate that process in any activity, especially in the classroom. 

It&#8217;s important to remember the struggle <del>we feel</del> I felt during this exercise is how someone feels daily in my classroom. Patience, empathy, and understanding the components of working through problems are essential for me as a leader and equally essential for students to learn.
