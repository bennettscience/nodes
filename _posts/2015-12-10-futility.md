The end of the semester is bittersweet. It&#8217;s exciting to think of the long break coming up. At the same time, the burden of work to be completed feels futile for many. I&#8217;ve been fighting significantly lower effort patterns and I don&#8217;t really have a good way to bridge the gap. Part of the issue this year is that I missed an entire week to stay home with the new baby. 

Not that I regret that time at all. By any means.

The theme for this week seems to be, &#8220;Why should I try? I can&#8217;t do anything about my grade now.&#8221; In some cases, this is true, and it&#8217;s a result of systematic, deliberate choices to not engage at any point along the way.

But.

I&#8217;m still responsible for helping my students learn. I&#8217;m _constantly_ reminding myself that I cannot do the learning **for** them. There has to be an inkling of effort to engage with the tasks.

&#8220;No, we can&#8217;t take a day off.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, we do have things to do today.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, this will be on the test.&#8221;

(that last one kills me.)

I need to take each class as they come and make the most of it.
