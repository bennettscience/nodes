We&#8217;re _playing_ with magnets this week in class. (We&#8217;re actually finishing _playing_ with magnets now.) It&#8217;s been great and this is by far one of my favorite units to teach because everything is so hands on. We&#8217;ve done lab activities every day. Magnets are accessible. They&#8217;re approachable by students. They&#8217;re easy to put your hands on and learn from.

_Play_ in science is crucial to the learning process. Mess with something, see what it does. Mess around again.

Today, some students were really _playing_ with ideas and others were just playing. 

There must be a balance. Finding that balance in allowing for _play_ alongside play is hard to strike because they can switch so quickly. Intentional situations (good design) help maintain the balance. Finding ways to make students _think_ they&#8217;re just playing around is a good way to have them really _play_ with ideas. 

It&#8217;s frustrating when that opportunity is missed.
