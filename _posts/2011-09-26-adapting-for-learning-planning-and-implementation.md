Here is what I&#8217;m look at for the middle steps of The Ladder I&#8217;m trying to build up for my learners. You can read Part 1 [here](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/adapting-for-learning-the-ladder/).

Obviously, before we begin these steps (3 and 4), we&#8217;ve given them the learning objectives for the chapter we&#8217;re moving to and they&#8217;ve taken some form of pre-assessment that will give learners the information they need to make informed decisions. This will also allow you to make sure they&#8217;re targeting the correct objectives for learning and not just taking shots in the dark.

In a straw poll, about half of my learners said they liked paper copies of materials, while the other half said they liked being able to do their work digitally. I&#8217;ll be keeping paper copies of these forms on hand if a learner needs one, and they&#8217;ll also be available for download to their computers or Google Docs if they want to go that route.

You can see the document [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iW10XIuzoZXN8z28OZjAOJ3m-fhzC1KutSh3IjRQavQ/edit?hl=en_US)

I have spaces for each of the standards they need to improve on and they systematically break down the content based on their needs.

In order to track each learner, they will be using a couple new forms. First, they&#8217;ll have to fill one out that mimics their weekly planning. I can keep a digital copy for quick recall each day if someone loses their paper, or if I need to get someone back on track with their learning. The second is a daily &#8220;What did I learn&#8221; form. They simply tell me what they learned&#8230;whether they did a lab, looked at some videos, ran a simulation&#8230;they need to articulate specifically what they worked on and how it applies to their learning plan.

As an added layer of tracking, I&#8217;ll also be initialing their work each week. So, it&#8217;ll take away the opportunity for excuses to be made for not progressing.

Again, this is all very fluid right now and I haven&#8217;t begun implementation yet. I&#8217;d appreciate comments and thoughts on this middle part as to how I could improve or tweak this to help learners progress through the content.
