You may have noticed that the URL for this blog has changed. It _should_ be updating your RSS feed and URL automatically when you visit, but just in case, the new URL is <http://blog.ohheybrian.com>. It&#8217;s part of a larger shift I&#8217;m making.

Links should still work fine to old posts, but in case you find a broken one, either leave a comment below, [get in touch with this form](http://ohheybrian.com/assets/connect.html), or send me a tweet (@bennettscience) and I&#8217;ll fix it.

Thanks, as always for reading.
