I&#8217;m going to stop doing labs in one of my classes this semester. Regardless of the supports or steps I put in place, there is a general refusal (save for 4 students who are trying their hardest to rise above the din) to follow procedure, listen to instructions, and work safely.

The class itself has become its own distraction. There lacks a visceral awareness of how actions impact others in the room, which has led to a general disregard for any form of structure. Labs are highly desirable because of the experience students get with the science, but they&#8217;re not _teaching_ anything. It&#8217;s effort I put in that isn&#8217;t spent on a significant learning gain. It&#8217;s also creating liabilities.

It&#8217;s all the more frustrating because I think they could do well with labs, but the class is fighting me for control. Power struggles aren&#8217;t suited for the lab space. For now, we&#8217;ll put those on the back burner until such a time we&#8217;ve regained enough self-control to work safely and effectively.

  Growth is a process and this year, it seems to be an extra intense one.
