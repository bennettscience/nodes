I&#8217;ve taken a big dive into test analysis lately. Spreadsheets, formulas, correlations, and color-coding have become the norm after an exam to help and identify misconceptions with my students as a whole and on a class-by-class basis.

One of the sheets I created (based on work done by [Andy Schwen](http://www.twitter.com/mrschwen) a few years back) color codes student responses in red if they got the question wrong, like this:

<img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-24_6-35-27.png" alt="2015-11-24_6-35-27" width="717" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4116" srcset="https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-24_6-35-27.png 717w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-24_6-35-27-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" />

I started wondering if there were significant patterns between classes looking at the scored matrix rather than statistical figures. I grabbed screenshots of each class, dropped the opacity of the image to ~35% and then layered them all to make this:

<img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/item_analysis_color.png" alt="item_analysis_color" width="713" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4117" srcset="https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/item_analysis_color.png 713w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/item_analysis_color-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" />

What made this doubly-interesting is that the darker red areas on the page do _not_ always line up with the statistical figures. For instance, I needed to revisit 2, 4, 9, 11, and 12 based on the statistical analysis (biserial value, if you&#8217;re curious). They had discrepancies between students who got it right _and_ did well on the test when compared to those who got it right and did poorly.

Looking at the picture, I also went back and revisited 8, 9, and 17 just because a lot of people missed them. I also looked at number 5 because very _few_ people got it wrong.

Teaching is science and art. Even if the art is doing test analysis.
