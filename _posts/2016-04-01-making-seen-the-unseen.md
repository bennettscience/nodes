My grading practices have improved this year. I&#8217;m keeping better track of information, I&#8217;m using it more often, and I&#8217;m showing students &#8211; constantly &#8211; their progress in their learning. The notion that grades only report ability is buried deep and digging it out has taken a lot &#8211; a _lot_ &#8211; of work.

Case in point: [I&#8217;ve already written](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/2016/03/expanding-the-sbg-tracking-gradebook/) about keeping better track of quizzes given on standards in class. That spreadsheet, at the end of the chapter, looks like this:

This shows some interesting things:

1. I can pinpoint sticking points on specific students much more accurately.

2. Blank spots &#8211; missing quizzes &#8211; _really_ hurts my ability to help. Same idea as [GIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out)&#8230;if I don&#8217;t have consistent information from students, I can&#8217;t help them as effectively.

3. These quiz scores _typically_ improve over time because older ideas set the foundation for new ideas. Yes, there is a dip in some cases, but I chalk that up to complexity rather than ability.

We just took the test and I found myself much less surprised than I used to be. (It pains me to even admit that I _used_ to be surprised&#8230;growth&#8230;) I can also whip that tracking chart back out and pair it up with test scores.

Yellow is a set of questions related to a specific learning objective for the chapter. For the most part, the yellow boxes correlate with the tracking page. The conversation _now_ centers on, &#8220;What mistakes am I still making?&#8221; rather than, &#8220;What do I have to do to get my grade up?&#8221;

It&#8217;s also great to ask a student if their test grade is a surprise and have them &#8211; even the most reluctant or disengaged &#8211; admit that no, it looks about right. Again, we can then focus on closing gaps in understanding and not point grubbing.
