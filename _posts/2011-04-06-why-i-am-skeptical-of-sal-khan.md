I suppose the title of this post says everything: I am skeptical of Sal Khan and I am worried about the influence he is having on education.

Now, if you&#8217;ve read this blog before (thank you, if you have), you might be wondering why I&#8217;m saying this. I am teaching a flipped chemistry class&#8230;his big point is that a flipped class is more effective than traditional classrooms because of 24/7 access, etc, etc.

I agree 100% with those comments.

So, why am I skeptical?

I&#8217;m skeptical because I&#8217;m afraid the flipped model is becoming a fad in the United States. I&#8217;m afraid its a buzzword that teachers (who don&#8217;t always understand the true working of the model) are going to start using to stay &#8220;current&#8221; or to keep administration happy.

I&#8217;m all for availability of material, and the [volume of material](http://www.khanacademy.org) that Mr. Khan has created and catalogued blows my mind (over 2,200 videos and counting). But, I&#8217;m concerned that teachers are going to turn these amazing resources into pop-and-play video lessons just to say they use them. I&#8217;m afraid that the power of the videos will be lost by just handing out an accompanying worksheet to fill in and get graded. I&#8217;m also afraid the availability of most curricula high schools offer will tempt teachers to sit back and stop teaching.

Again, I&#8217;m all for availability of resources, but there is also something to be said about learning from _your_ teacher&#8230;not just a disembodied voice on YouTube.

So, I guess I should have titled this &#8220;How Do We Keep the Flipped Class From Becoming Ineffective?&#8221; It&#8217;s not what Mr. Khan is saying that worries me&#8230;its what the people that are listening to him will ultimately do with this idea. What I would like to see is more everyday teachers getting the focus. There are hundreds of teachers in the US alone using a flipped class&#8230;but they don&#8217;t get invited to do TED Talks or speak at keynote conventions.

I am convinced the power of flipping a classroom lies in the word-of-mouth transmission. We need teachers using a flipped model to step out and become more vocal about their methods. There are people like Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams (the guys I learned from) in Colorado, working very, very hard to promote the flipped classroom. We need to organize meetings, classroom visits, tutorials, webinars&#8230;anything that will help spread the word on how to _effectively_ use podcasting in the classroom.
