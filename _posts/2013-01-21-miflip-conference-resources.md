On Saturday, 1/19, we held the first [Michigan Flipped Learning conference](http://miflip.wordpress.com) in Byron Center, MI. [We recorded as many of the sessions as we could](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/watch-the-mi-flipteaching-conference-free/), so I&#8217;ve linked them all below. They were recorded with Google+ Hangouts On Air, so some of the audio and video might be a little less-than-HD, but the resources are valuable nonetheless. I&#8217;ve also linked public Google Documents created with links and other notes from the sessions. Feel free to share these resources with colleagues that may be interested in Flipped Learning.
