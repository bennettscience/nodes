I wasn&#8217;t planning on writing this afternoon, but I saw a post on Twitter from [Steven Anderson](http://www.twitter.com/web20classroom),

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-725" title="Innovation" src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-24-at-2.59.58-PM.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="" width="356" height="170" srcset="https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-24-at-2.59.58-PM.png 356w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-24-at-2.59.58-PM-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" />

and it really got me thinking. What is innovation? I can see what Steven is getting at. What happens when everyone is innovating&#8230;is that not innovation anymore?

I thought for a minute and sent back this reply,

As I teach longer, I keep finding that I think the best practices in the classroom are not necessarily putting the class agenda on the whiteboard or using a word wall to help teach vocabulary or literacy. Those are things&#8230;they aren&#8217;t at the root of doing what I do. When it comes down to it, I think best practices are really a combination of how we _think_ about teaching and what that thinking causes us to _do._

I can dream all day long about how I can innovate in my room&#8230;I do that every day. I think that is part of the Achilles heel of technology. There is always something new that we want to try, but we have to have the tech to make it happen. Would I turn down a class set of iPads? No way. But is _not_ having them going to stop me from trying new things? Absolutely not.

Innovation isn&#8217;t always thinking about new ways to do things. We aren&#8217;t in the business of thinking&#8230;we&#8217;re in the business of doing. And that includes failure. I am an innovator because I am willing to try those crazy ideas. I may never use them again and I may not change the world with it, but that doesn&#8217;t make me any less of an innovator. It&#8217;s all in your mind.
