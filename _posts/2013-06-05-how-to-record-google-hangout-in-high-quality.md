I&#8217;m working on a super-secret project right now (more to come this summer&#8230;bear with me) which will require me to record interviews via Google Hangout. Now, I know I&#8217;ve written before about how to [screencast on a Chromebook](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/screencasting-on-chromebooks/) using Google+, but the quality of those recordings, in particular the audio, can leave something to be desired. So, I went looking for an alternative.

I fell down the rabbit trail of apps that do this and that, but none of them really did what I needed. I knew I wanted to use [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to record and edit, but I couldn&#8217;t find an easy way to record both my microphone as well as the system audio for the people I&#8217;m speaking with.

Luckily, I&#8217;m currently going through [ds106](http://www.ds106.us) with some radio geniuses who where able to help. I can&#8217;t go any further without giving [ScottLo](http://www.twitter.com/scottlo) a MAJOR shout out for helping me work this out. Rather than type the entire process out, I&#8217;ve got a video showing how I set everything up to record the Google Hangout. Beneath that, you can see the tools (with links) and their settings written out.
