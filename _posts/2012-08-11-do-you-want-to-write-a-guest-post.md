I want to try something new. In addition to the writing I normally do, I want to give some more people a chance to publish a guest post on my blog. I get to talk to many of you through Twitter, but I also want to include other voices on a larger platform. Hopefully, this will spur more discussion and discourse on teaching and learning in connected classrooms.

If you&#8217;re interested in posting:
  
&#8211; Your post needs to be ready to publish starting on August 27th.
  
&#8211; Your final article should be original and between 500 &#8211; 750 words in length.
  
&#8211; Focus on pedagogy or methods in your class or school.
  
&#8211; Please don&#8217;t write a list of tech tools you use. I&#8217;m looking for discourse on how you&#8217;re changing your class with what you&#8217;ve learned.
  
&#8211; The application deadline is August 15th. Selected writers will be notified no later than August 17th.
  
&#8211; The content is yours, and you&#8217;re free to cross-post the article on your blog 24 hours later.

If all of that looks good, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dERQaUFJRFByelRyekRLLS1PR3oxNFE6MQ). I&#8217;m closing the form the evening of August 15th, so make sure you have it in before then!
