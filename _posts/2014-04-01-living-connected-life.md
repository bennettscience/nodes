Everyone is connected. There are reports of so-called [&#8220;disconnect anxiety&#8221;](http://www.switched.com/2008/03/12/68-of-americans-suffer-from-disconnect-anxiety/) afflicting our society because our desire to know what&#8217;s happening all the time. I have to admit, I&#8217;ve suffered from this. When I had a flip phone, I felt like I was missing out on the flow of my PLN and missing out on great ideas being shared. I have a smart phone now, but I&#8217;m ready to take it to the next level.

Tomorrow, beginning at 8AM, I&#8217;m going to begin my Connected Life experiment. For one entire day, I&#8217;m going to broadcast my life through a Google Hangout on Air.

Want to know what it&#8217;s like to work from home? Tune in to the Hangout. Want to know what my house looks like? Tune into the Hangout. Curious what I wear when I work from home? Tune into the Hangout.

This is an unprecedented look into my life, and I want my PLN there. Feel free to share it with your friends, turn it on in the background, or just hop on to see what&#8217;s up. I&#8217;ll also be doing a live Q&A through Twitter all day, so if you want to know more, hit me up at [@bennettscience](http://www.twitter.com/bennettscience).

Looking for the live stream? [Here&#8217;s the link](javascript:window.open('http://www.brianbennett.org/index/live-stream.html','Live Stream','width=1100,height=740')). It&#8217;ll go live tomorrow morning at 8AM!
