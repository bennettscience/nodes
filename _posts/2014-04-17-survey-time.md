Blog readers, I come to you again asking for help with a survey.

As many of you know, I&#8217;m working on a masters degree in education technology through Michigan State University. I have a short survey in circulation looking at technology integration and the associated professional development. It will take 5-10 minutes, and your help would be greatly appreciated.

Please pass the link along to friends, colleagues, or your social networks. I&#8217;ll be gathering data over the next few days and then posting an analysis late this week/early next.
