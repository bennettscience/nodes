In the silence, a shuffle is a landslide.
  
Clicks and ticks shake the air.
  
Furrowed brows rattle individual hairs.

Teaching is a human invention, the same is true for our Assessments.
  
learning has been around for longer than you or I.
  
(And you don&#8217;t need a test to show you know that.)

We are a culture of inventions, addicted to &#8220;data-adds-value.&#8221;
  
We forget that we all used to learn at one time.
  
We used to know more about the world, but then, schools started.

In the silence, our history slips away.
