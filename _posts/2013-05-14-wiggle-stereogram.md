[I mentioned last night](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/where-is-all-the-time-ds106-4life/) that I&#8217;m going to work along with UMW&#8217;s summer DS106 section beginning next Monday. In order to get ready, I&#8217;m cracking my GIF knuckles and getting my workflow down so I can spend more brain power on problem solving rather than just doing the work.

I went through the [DS106 Assignment Bank](http://assignments.ds106.us/types/visualassignments/page/8/), looking for something that would catch my eye. I came across the [Wiggle Setereoscopy](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/wiggle-stereoscopy/) assignment. Mostly because it had a hilarious name, I took a look at it and tried it out.

I didn&#8217;t want to use an app to make the stereogram, because I felt like that would be cheating somehow. I wanted to take my own pictures and then use GIMP to make it dance. My first two attempts were terrible because my photos were too far apart. I learned after trying twice that the camera difference needs to be _very_ small. Much smaller than you would assume&#8230;and that was the hardest part of the assignment.

I took a two photos of my AT2020 USB mic sitting on my bookshelf and then opened them as layers in GIMP.

The first thing I did was crop the photo down to a manageable size. With the original at over 3000px wide, it was a little overwhelming. The final version is 700px wide.

I really wanted to do something like [Alan&#8217;s](http://cogdogblog.com/2012/07/27/two-quick-wigglers/), where the object was nearly stationary in the middle. I dropped the opacity on the top layer and tried to line it up as best I could, but because of the way I moved the camera when I took the photo, there&#8217;s still a little wiggle.

Then, it was just a matter of bringing the opacity back up, tweaking the frame rate (I ended up with 75ms per frame), optimizing for a GIF, and exporting the file. All in all, it took me about 20 minutes to do (minus all the photography trial and error from throughout the day) and I&#8217;m pretty happy with the result.
