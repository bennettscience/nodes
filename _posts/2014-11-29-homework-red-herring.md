Polarization is easy to achieve, but it&#8217;s hard to undo. Education is riddled with polarizing issues, both political and practical, and the issue of homework is one of the worst.

The central argument: Homework doesn&#8217;t benefit students, and you shouldn&#8217;t be giving it.

Aside from pushing buttons and for increasing retweets, search hits, and Klout scores, the homework argument doesn&#8217;t go much farther than that. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also gotten to the point where teachers who _do_ give homework feel ostracized in the popular education social spheres. Apparently, that means they&#8217;re bad teachers, so instead of trying to engage with an already polarized community, they hunker down and don&#8217;t bring it up.

It&#8217;s a tragedy that we can&#8217;t talk about teaching without diving into our camps.

Homework in and of itself is no more a &#8220;bad&#8221; thing than giving multiple choice tests or lecturing in class. What&#8217;s bad is when we do those things &#8211; or _any_ thing &#8211; without thinking through what we&#8217;re doing and why we&#8217;re doing it. Rather than pushing for ideological conformity, why don&#8217;t we take time to discuss what the real issues are behind each action?

Let&#8217;s consider some valid reasons to have work done outside school hours:

**Students need time to process their learning individually**. This isn&#8217;t always done best in the classroom. Time to reflect, process, or otherwise chew on information alone should be done outside of school because it is more conducive to finding insight.

**Practice**. Don&#8217;t shoot the messenger, but _skills need to be practiced_. Again, corporate time in the classroom is not necessarily the best place for individual practice to take place.

**Teaching time management**. If we had unlimited and unscripted time during the school day, maybe I wouldn&#8217;t use this one in particular. But, when we get down to nuts and bolts, we can&#8217;t give unlimited time to accomplishing a task &#8211; and before you get all &#8220;real-world&#8221; on me, yes, it happens in places other than school.

**Exploration of ideas**. I would love to provide a fully immersive environment for my students, but I can&#8217;t replicate a forest in the building. Sending students out to take a walk and experience their environment requires that they do it outside of school.

We get so hung up on _where_ this stuff happens that we miss the bigger point. Yes, I had students who took care of siblings, played sports, or worked. I did my best to limit the volume of work outside of school, but I think it&#8217;s a bigger adjustment to change what _kind_ of work happens outside of school. Perhaps it isn&#8217;t the fact that homework exists but rather the homework we give tends to suck.
