The first attempt at anything is usually inefficient, clunky, and unpolished.  That&#8217;s how I feel with my class at the moment.  I&#8217;m trying to polish and refine, but I need to be patient, because I will probably never be completely satisfied&#8230;but I think good teachers are never comfortable with everything they do.  We need to be finding ways to constantly improve our methodology and be refining our pedagogy.

The biggest challenge I&#8217;ve had thus far with mastery is the unbelievable volume of daily grading and checking I&#8217;ve been doing and the brainpower it is taking me to think about 10 different assignments all being shown to me at once.  Feeling fried out (after one unit, mind you) I queried Jonathan Bergmann, a mastery guru (he&#8217;s in his 4th year using the method right now).  [A recent blog post](http://blendedclassroom.blogspot.com/2010/09/assessing-in-mastery-learning-what-we.html) of his had to do with how he and a colleague switched from grading every assignment to grading specific objectives they wanted students to accomplish.  Needless to say, I loved it.

I will be using this with my next unit, but I wanted to share his thoughts.  I am in no way responsible for coming up with the idea&#8230;I&#8217;m just borrowing from him to try and improve my class&#8230;thanks Jon!
