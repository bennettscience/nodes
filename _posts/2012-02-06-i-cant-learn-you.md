<a href="http://www.thethinkingstick.com/flipping-history/" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">I read a post</a> from [Jeff Utecht](http://www.twitter.com/jutecht) just ten minutes ago which got me into this thought. He wrote about helping a teacher flip her history classroom:

> Parents [are] calling into question the idea that the teacher isn’t “teaching my child” and the frustration their child is having to “find the right answer.”

I&#8217;ve been fielding a lot of questions lately about how to _do_ a flipped classroom. I do my best to guide and show different resources, but when it really comes down to it, you need to do what makes sense for your classes. If it involves video lectures, then we can make lectures. If it involves a research project, then we can design a project. What it comes down to is the fact that students are taking responsibility for their learning. I can help you scaffold and plan for it, but I don&#8217;t know your class or your school&#8217;s culture.

All this to say: sometimes teachers do the same thing. I have led sessions where people want to what _exactly_ they need to do to have a flipped class. I tell them the same thing I tell my students: **there is no one right answer.** It depends on your class, purpose, and learning culture.

True learning comes from exploration, risk-taking, assessment, and reflection. Let&#8217;s work on stepping out of our old habits and start embracing and emulating that model with our students.
