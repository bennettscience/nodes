We all need time to do things we love. But, time is not always on our side. Neither are the people around us. Henry Bemis lived a life in which he found solace in books, and contempt from everyone around him. In [Time Enough at Last](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last), he is given an opportunity to forget the world and live in his books, but the Twilight Zone had other ideas.

I tackled the [One Story/Four Icons](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/one-story-four-icons/) design assignment to get the juices flowing. I had a lot of great ideas after watching [Tim Owens](http://www.twitter.com/timmyboy) and [Jim](http://www.twitter.com/jimgroom) on the ds106.tv show about design yesterday. One I had known about was [The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com), but I had forgotten about it until the show. So, I hopped over there to grab some images and get going.

I started with 5 icons (full disclosure here) and then combined the man&#8217;s head with the mustache to make myself a Bemis. So, in the end, I still ended up with four icons (I&#8217;m not a cheater.)

<div id="attachment_2156" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis.jpg"><img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis.jpg" alt="A story, decomposed to elements." width="1000" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2156" srcset="https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis-300x192.jpg 300w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis-100x64.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    A story, decomposed to elements.
  </p>
</div>

To get the broken lens, I simply used the circle selector and chose the space inside the glasses icon. Then, I grew the selection (Selection > Grow) by 3px to grab some of the edge. Then, I used the Transform tool to skew the lens (we&#8217;re getting deep here (yes, that is a terrible pun)) to show some depth. Filled in some lines, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a cracked lens. This didn&#8217;t take me too long, so I decided to beef it up a little and give myself another star in the process.

Rather than a still image, I decided to GIF this into something a little more interesting.

<div id="attachment_2161" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis.gif"><img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bemis.gif" alt="When things go wrong, they really go wrong." width="1000" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2161" /></a>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    When things go wrong, they <i>really</i> go wrong.
  </p>
</div>

(I played with the timing a lot. I&#8217;m happy with what I came up with).

Just like Mr. Bemis, he thought things would turn out one way, only to find that circumstances often get the best of us, no matter how much we plan.
