I lost my job on Friday.

It sucks, but life moves on.

I&#8217;ve started applying for schools, but it isn&#8217;t really a good hiring time right now. So, in the meantime, I&#8217;m speaking and doing some freelance web design. If you are looking for someone to lead a PD day at your school, please <a href="http://www.ohheybrian.com/assets/connect.html" target="blank">contact me through my homepage</a> for more information. I&#8217;d also appreciate referrals and recommendations. 

I&#8217;m excited about what opportunities are ahead.
