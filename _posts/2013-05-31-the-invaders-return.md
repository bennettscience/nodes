Man, this has been a long week. Aside from the [remodel I began on my house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bennettscience/sets/72157633760342509/), we had family visiting and a sick wife to boot. So, my ds106 work had come to a relative halt. I worked on some here and there, but couldn&#8217;t really sit down and put in some time.

I decided to do a sound story in which the United States revisits the giant&#8217;s planet&#8230;and let&#8217;s say things go a little bit differently. The story is below.

[soundcloud url=&#8221;http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/94827778&#8243; params=&#8221;&#8221; width=&#8221; 100%&#8221; height=&#8221;166&#8243; iframe=&#8221;true&#8221; /]

This is actually about half sound effects from [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org) and half from my own house remodel, with the different noises being used mostly for the machines that come out of the spaceship. The woman is caught off guard this time, and well&#8230;you tell me what happens.

In a perfect world, I would have had a design assignment to go along with this, but I&#8217;m just not going to get to it. If I do, I&#8217;ll be sure to post it.
