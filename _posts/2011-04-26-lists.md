I&#8217;m fairly new to the education blogging realm. I haven&#8217;t even been posting consistently for a year now, but I&#8217;m getting better at it and I&#8217;m refining my ideas and my voice as I continue to post.

I&#8217;m even newer to Twitter, having just signed up for an account in March. Again, I&#8217;m finding my voice as I explore opportunities and ways to build a PLN.

I do have one pet-peeve, however. I hate _&#8220;X number of ways to use awesome-internet-tool-Y.&#8221;_

I feel like many times I have my twitter feed open, that&#8217;s 90% of what comes through.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are some great posts out there with resources for classrooms.  But, how do I know which ones are the &#8220;good ones&#8221; and which ones will I open only to close again in 3 seconds.

To me, the &#8220;good ones&#8221; are pages or blog posts that give A) fewer than 10 resources and B) _actual uses in the classroom_.

Think about it&#8230;if you&#8217;re looking for a hotel when planning a trip, obviously you need to do some searching through the haystack to find your needle.  But, if you have a friend or an acquaintance that recommends a hotel and _why_ they like it, 9 times out of 10, I&#8217;m staying at the friend&#8217;s hotel.

The internet is the same way.  I <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=word+cloud+software" target="_blank">did a Google search for &#8220;word cloud software&#8221;</a> and got 130 _million_ hits.  Talk about a haystack.  I don&#8217;t have time to go through them all.  I want to know which ones work and which ones do other people like.

I love collaboration and I love finding new tools.  But teachers, let&#8217;s face it, we don&#8217;t have the most free time in the world to sift through dozens and dozens of web tools in these types of posts.

Let&#8217;s share the best of what we&#8217;ve found and let&#8217;s stop filling web space with empty lists.
