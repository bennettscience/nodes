School is getting started again for just about everyone and as flipped learning becomes more and more popular, we&#8217;re all looking to make connections to continue our growth.

The first way is to join in on our [#flipclass chat](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/flipclass-chat/) Monday nights at 8PM EDT. We have a wonderful team of moderators (many who are included below) that help host the chat each week. Topics are chosen by a poll that is tweeted out Sunday nights and Monday mornings. We&#8217;ve gone strong since beginning in March this year, and we&#8217;re looking forward to expanding as a new school year begins.

If you&#8217;re looking for content-specific folks, this is a list of some amazing flipped educators I&#8217;ve created just off the top of my head. If there is someone I missed, please add them in the comments.

**English**

[Cheryl Morris](http://www.twitter.com/guster4lovers/) and [Andrew Thomasson](http://www.twitter.com/thomasson_engl/) are a dynamic duo who co-teach their English classes. With Cheryl in the Bay Area and Andrew across the country in North Carolina, they use Google+ Hangouts to create content and flip their classes from 2,500 miles away. You can [read about their story](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/guest-post-alchemy-in-the-midst-of-chaos-collaboration-and-community-in-the-flipped-classroom/) or take a look at their materials on their [collaborative website](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmiclass.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHVzVYIoaGGLrl2yPaGr955fAyaLQ) or [YouTube](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FThomassonMorrisInstr%2Fvideos).

**Math**

[Stacey Roshan](http://www.twitter.com/buddyxo/) is a high school math teacher in Potomac, Maryland. Her flipped class focuses on [reducing student anxiety](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/the-flip-turning-a-classroom-upside-down/2012/06/03/gJQAYk55BV_story.html) through flexible testing and student created content.. Stacey&#8217;s content is on her [class website](http://bullis.haikulearning.com/roshast) and on [Screencast.com](http://www.screencast.com/users/Ms.Roshan/folders/AP%20Calculus%20AB).

[Crystal Kirch](http://www.twitter.com/crystalkirch/) teaches freshman algebra and math analysis in California. She developed a Watch-Summary-Question (WSQ, pronounced “whisk”) cycle with her videos that has taken off in flipped learning circles. She writes very frequently on her [blog](http://flippingwithkirch.blogspot.com/) and posts her content to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/crystalkirch?feature=results_main) or on her dedicated [Algebra I](http://kirchalgebra1.blogspot.com) and [Math Analysis](http://kirchmathanalysis.blogspot.com) class websites.
