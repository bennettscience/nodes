Ever since the [State of the Union](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-president-state-union-address) address on January 24th, I have seen more blog posts and articles on STEM than I have in a very, very long time. The problem is, they&#8217;re all focusing on the wrong thing.

I feel like I&#8217;m channeling [Michael Doyle](http://doyle-scienceteach.blogspot.com/) and even [Dan Meyer](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/) today, but it really is getting to the point where the nation&#8217;s science, math, technology, and engineering teachers need to speak up more and let policymakers know that they aren&#8217;t allowing us to teach anymore. 

Science can&#8217;t be &#8220;taught.&#8221; I can tell kids how chromosomes randomly separate into sperm and eggs that eventually _might_ become a living organism, but that takes so much away from the magic of seeing how diverse life is when the two meet. I am required to teach how to find the probability of what the results of a cross will be, but you cannot cage life into a Punnett square. But, by law, that&#8217;s what I have to do. I&#8217;m evaluated on it. My students are evaluated on it. But, in reality, they aren&#8217;t being evaluated on what they know about science.

Science is living. Science is making observations, asking questions, and then finding what seems to be a good explanation for what you saw. Science is communal. They need time to debate, to discuss, and to troubleshoot. Otherwise, we&#8217;re just teaching letters and numbers now and _that&#8217;s_ our science scores are so low. 

Science has become artificial, and just like artificial grass, the burn hurts much more when you fall down.
