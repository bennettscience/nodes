The first major break of the holidays is upon us, and I&#8217;m in the mood to do some giveaways. Over the last 18 months, I&#8217;ve contributed (along with the likes of [Steve Kelly](http://www.twitter.com/bigkxcountry), [Kristin Daniels](http://www.twitter.com/kadaniels), [Crystal Kirch](http://www.twitter.com/crystalkirch), and more) to some fantastic books and I&#8217;ve got some extra copies that need to be read.

For this round, I&#8217;m giving away a physical copy of _Flipped Learning &#8211; Gateway to Student Engagement_ (2014) by Jon Bergmann and Aaron Sams (pictured above).

If you&#8217;re interested, please **share this post** and then leave a comment below. I&#8217;ll use the [random number generator](http://www.random.org/) to pick a winner Monday evening at 9:00 PM EST. You&#8217;ll have a day to contact me [through my website&#8217;s form](http://ohheybrian.com/assets/connect.html) to claim your prize.

Be sure to [add this site to your RSS feed reader](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/feed) for future updates and other book giveaways over the next few weeks!
