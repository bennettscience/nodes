This Sunday, I&#8217;m jetting off to Germany for a one week, three city, two-conference tour with fellow TechSmithie, Anton Bollen. Part of my trip is speaking with German educators about Flipped Learning, and this year, specifically about student responses (both good and bad) to flipping. If you have five minutes to spare, I would really appreciate your help in gathering some very unofficial stories.

There is a section for students _and_ teachers. So, if you&#8217;d be willing to share it with your students as well, that would be some great evidence to share next week. Just like the last survey I did, you can fill it out below or on the form itself.

If you&#8217;d like to share the form with friends or colleagues, please use <a href="http://bit.ly/stuflip" target="blank">http://bit.ly/stuflip</a> so I can track the clicks on it.
