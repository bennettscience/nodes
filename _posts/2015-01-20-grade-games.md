I get asked abou my grading a lot because it&#8217;s pretty different than a typical classroom. I&#8217;ve refined it slowly over the years, and I&#8217;m by no means totally happy with it, but I&#8217;m happy with how it&#8217;s changed the way I (and my students, eventually) think about grades.

I tend to <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/communication-in-grading/" target="blank">struggle</a> and <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/grades-revisited/" target="blank">wrestle</a> with what grading communicates, even if it&#8217;s not something students (or other teachers or parents) latch on to at first. I&#8217;m a big believer in the idea that everything we do sends a signal about what we believe. Grading is at the heart of school (unfortunately) and the policies in place say a lot about teachers.

**1. I grade skills, not papers**. I don&#8217;t care what papers get turned in. It doesn&#8217;t _prove_ anything to me. Mostly because copying is rampant, and this helps curb that tendency. Writing something down does not equal understanding. I want to see application and thought. That _can_ happen in writing, but it&#8217;s easier to see in the moment with probing questions and observation. I think at the core, you could call this modified Standards Based Grading.

**2. I want to see evidence**. Papers may not be graded themselves, but they can serve to build an argument to demonstrate understanding. A student may have the written work &#8211; even copied at times &#8211; but it lays a foundation for their understanding. So, keeping track of notes, worksheets, labs, etc., can build a more convincing argument for learning. But, remember, students still need to communicate the skill in addition to showing the evidence.

**3. I make sure grades are fluid**. Once a grade is in the book, it isn&#8217;t final (up until the quarter/semester deadline, at least). If a student isn&#8217;t happy with their grade, they can take a minute to make it better. With this system, it&#8217;s not just a missing assignment: it&#8217;s a gap in a student&#8217;s understanding. The standards are specific, and they can go back to work on that _one idea_ to improve their grade. At the same time, I&#8217;m reinforcing the fact that I care about what they learn, and not what they turn in.

I don&#8217;t have a specific book setup, other than each standard goes into the book as a one (you get it) or a zero (you don&#8217;t). I don&#8217;t play with percentage arguments because it&#8217;s all subjective. If a student feels they deserve a 90 rather than an 85 on a lab, prove to me why, and I&#8217;m happy to change it. Grading should really be the ultimate form of formative feedback &#8211; a glance at where they are on a given day that informs work for the future.
