A year ago, [I posted a script](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/2015/04/making-endnotes-from-footnotes/) which converts footnotes in a Google Doc into endnotes. I&#8217;ve gotten great comments and feedback and have made the standalone script better, which is still available.

The [Endnote Generator Add-On](http://dev.ohheybrian.com/endnotes) is now available in the [Chrome Web Store for Docs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/endnote-generator/nmhebcalinkmgflgcfapknjhbliebooc). Install it once and you&#8217;ll be able to create endnotes from the footnotes you&#8217;ve already inserted in your doc.

There are a couple of known issues (pictures with a footnote aren&#8217;t included yet), but if you run into anything, leave a note here or [on GitHub](https://github.com/bennettscience/endnotes).

[Check out the Endnote Generator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/endnote-generator/nmhebcalinkmgflgcfapknjhbliebooc).
