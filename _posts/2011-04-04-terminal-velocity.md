This week, my students are about to finish unit 7, thermochemistry. Looking back one year, I was a little bit further ahead (in terms of content) but this same chapter was chapter 6, not chapter 7.

That&#8217;s a very roundabout way of saying this year, using the flipped model, I&#8217;ve been able to add _an entire unit of study_ just by flipping the class. This blew me away when I realized how much time I had gained.

Then, I began to think about how I was able to move through the content so quickly. Did I add to student misconception because I was so caught up in wanting this flipped model to be &#8220;more&#8221; successful because I could cover more material? Right now, after using this model for the past year, I would say no. But, thinking about my motivations as I started this model, I&#8217;m afraid to say it probably was a major factor in my decision to switch.

As I&#8217;ve learned more about student achievement and how the content isn&#8217;t as important as teaching the student, I&#8217;ve taken a _major_ step back to think about my motivations. Sure, it would be great if I could move through the material faster, but only if students are performing at a higher level. Have I sacrificed student understanding to reach a specific end? I hope not.

The whole point of this is to say that technology is great and its easy to move through the material quickly because it is available 24/7. But, that does not mean that we _should_ move at the speed of light through the content. Take time for supplemental activities and outside information. Take time for fun activities and keep the students interested in what you&#8217;re doing.

Don&#8217;t use technology as a means to reach content&#8217;s end.
