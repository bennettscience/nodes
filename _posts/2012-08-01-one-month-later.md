On July 2nd, I wrote a short [post](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/where-do-we-go-now/) about taking some time off for the month. Well, the month is over, I haven&#8217;t written a single article, and now I&#8217;m trying to decide what to focus on first.

I&#8217;ve been thinking **a lot** about defining my learning spaces this year. I&#8217;ve got some ideas about creating an inviting and inspiring space for students. I have some ideas, but I really want it to be my students who drive what happens. One thing I&#8217;ve thought about is a collage wall, where students can post pictures of their learning, especially learning _outside_ of school. Hopefully, the photos will spark conversations and students will become experts in a certain area, and the pictures will help them tell their stories. We&#8217;ll see what happens with that.

I&#8217;ve also been thinking about flipped learning and what role it will play in my class this year. Again, the space is a major issue, but I&#8217;m also continuing to think about how learning will be defined next year. I&#8217;ll be writing more on the pedagogy behind flipping and what it looks like in my situation. I would also like to begin writing more about common threads found in all areas being flipped. We need to begin pushing the discussion further.

Finally, I am going to be working on the structure and content of my class website. I need to get back to the basics of what I&#8217;m teaching and streamline the content for my students. I&#8217;ll be making some changes to the course outlines as well as the videos within the course in an attempt to make them more interactive and not solely content delivery. Again, I&#8217;m not totally sure what the course will look like when this is done, but I&#8217;m excited about the possibilities.

When I wasn&#8217;t thinking about school, I learned how to [make yogurt](http://www.makeyourownyogurt.com/), moved into a new apartment, went to Colorado for a wedding, and rode a bike in a ride across Indiana.
