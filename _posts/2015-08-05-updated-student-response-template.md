A while back, I wrote about a new Google Sheets response system I created for use in class. I suggest you go back and [read that first](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/google-sheets-student-response-system/) if you haven&#8217;t read it yet.

First, [I uploaded the template in to the gallery](https://drive.google.com/embeddedtemplate?id=1TNAex2Mo9-VfXe6RNhBT8NqPT9m0CbN9bvHbz-zDBJg). That&#8217;s the best place to download and use the spreadsheet because everything copies over correctly.

The biggest update is in the setup process. Rather than posting a URL on your board, it will now create a QR code automatically for your students to scan.

Notice the tab at the bottom wasn&#8217;t there before clicking the button &#8211; it adds the code to a new sheet. **You only need to do this once** because the other functions (outlined in the first post) clear out responses in the template with each question.
