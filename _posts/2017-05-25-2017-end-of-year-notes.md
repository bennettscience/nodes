In what&#8217;s become a half-tradition, some unfiltered thoughts as I finish another school year.

&#8211; Splitting time between teaching and instructional coaching is really, really difficult. It&#8217;s hard to pour into both equally. Next year, I&#8217;m going to be coaching 100% of the time.

&#8211; I still need to work on alternative assessment and measurement methods. Using Canvas has helped me implement SBG more effectively this year, but I still need to make improvements, especially giving feedback.

&#8211; I tend to close in on myself when working with other teachers. I need to focus on opening up and encouraging reflective dialog about effective instructional strategies.

&#8211; As I work with curriculum development and implementation teams, I need to bone up on my frameworks.

&#8211; I&#8217;m not teaching a class next year, which feels very strange&#8230;again.

There is a ton of change happening in the district and the implementation of the growth plan is wide open. My team continues to set high goals to make sure we&#8217;re _constantly_ pushing the bar. It takes a lot of energy and effort, but the growth this year has been astronomical. Maintaining momentum and implementing new support structures in the fall is the big challenge ahead.
