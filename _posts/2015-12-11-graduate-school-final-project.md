I promised [Stacy Lovdahl](http://www.twitter.com/braveneutrino) I&#8217;d post this the other day and then promptly forgot. Sorry, Stacy.

I took a graduate course on curriculum development and implementation this semester through Ball State. Not many of the assignments were open-ended enough to make for interesting blog fodder, so I didn&#8217;t post much. For my final project, I chose to redesign the course of study for my school based on an inquiry model. There are two components: [the redesign document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14a6gGT9TuqDFBTv5YaEzE3XqbOgNZSMoDEcsHuDKU5g/edit) and [the theory backing it up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Czqrsh_74Y4H6sFoQ-hMxFSsUikVelf4mF-22fIg_e4/edit#heading=h.rjc9mjejveyb). They&#8217;re both available as Google docs with comments opened. 

Many, many thanks to [Michelle Baldwin](http://www.twitter.com/michellek107) and [Kelly Tenkely](http://www.twitter.com/ktenkely) from [Anastasis Academy](http://www.anastasisacademy.com) for late-night questions about inquiry mapping, standards reporting, and pretty much anything I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around. Check out the work they&#8217;re doing&#8230;it&#8217;s amazing.
