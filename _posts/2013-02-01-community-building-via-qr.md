One of my new favorite stops in my morning reading is the Fast Company series. I subscribe to the [Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com) blog, but I also browse the [Create](http://www.fastcocreate.com) and [Exist](http://www.fastcoexist.com) blogs as well. I came across a post on the [Exist](http://www.fastcoexist.com) series on a new initiative by the city of Bristol in England. Citizens can [text codes on inanimate objects](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/community-building-via-qr/) in throughout the city and have conversations. The point is to have _fun_ in the city. The point is to interact with our surroundings. Are you a ghost? Photo is mine Nooooo! Photo is mine.

I got to thinking about how we don&#8217;t interact enough with the spaces we have in schools. So, I began a small project. I [created QR codes](http://delivr.com/) with simple text. Some are little quips such as this gem from [Brett Clark](http://www.twitter.com/Mr_Brett_Clark):

Another awards a &#8220;Curiosity Badge&#8221; (totally made up and unofficial&#8230;for now) that students can retrieve just for being curious enough to stop and scan. The whole point of this is to be _fun_, and to get kids and staff to interact with their surroundings.

I chose to use [Delivr](http://www.delivr.com) to create the codes because they offer tracking and scan analytics. I haven&#8217;t received and data yet, even though I scanned a few myself just to make sure they worked properly, so I don&#8217;t know about reporting times to the account. Hopefully, I can gather some unofficial data about technology our students already have in the building as we continue to improve instructional tool use.

Hopefully, if this catches on a little bit, I&#8217;ll add some small quests and other achievements students can earn. I&#8217;m also planning on entering small challenges like, &#8220;Tell someone they matter to you,&#8221; in an effort to get people in the building communicating in positive ways with one another. I&#8217;m also hoping students begin to have &#8220;random acts of creativity&#8221; that help us grow together as a school.

Have you started something like this in your school? What suggestions do you have?
