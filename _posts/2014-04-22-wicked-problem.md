**Post Updated 4/27/14 9:15PM** &#8211; Since writing this post, my group has finished our project. Rather than adding a separate post, I&#8217;ve updated the links below to the [final recommendation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOIMh5hjNjeZcpuXWFsC34gw-Oc8n3AG1fruDK7XKQQ/edit).

The semester is winding down and that means final projects are wrapping up. In _Applying Edtech to Practice_, my group tackled the problem of &#8220;rethinking teaching.&#8221; Essentially, we came up with a suggestion for how teachers can improve their practice based on The Danielson Group&#8217;s teacher evaluation tool. 

The Framework for Teaching has four components: 

  1. Planning and Preparation
  2. The Classroom Environment
  3. Instruction
  4. Professional Responsibilities

The instrument breaks each area down into indicators which we used to outline our proposal. Using the TPACK framework as a guide, we looked at each subgroup in the Framework and linked them to simple tools teachers can use to move toward the distinguished level of performance.

To organize everything, [we&#8217;ve created a Popplet as a graphic organizer](http://popplet.com/app/#/1804223). From there, you can learn more about The Danielson Group, the TPACK framework for applying technology as well as see our [white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOIMh5hjNjeZcpuXWFsC34gw-Oc8n3AG1fruDK7XKQQ/edit) recommendation and video of the process we used to create the final product.

Any feedback in the comments would be appreciated. <del>The final revision will be posted later this week.<del /></p>
