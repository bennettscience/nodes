I promised people that I would post pictures and/or a video on how I watched the Venus transit last night. Well, they&#8217;re ready to share.





It was great to be able to watch this in real time. I was worried earlier in the afternoon because the cloud cover really picked up, but it cleared out right at six o&#8217;clock, just before the transit began at 6:09 PM.

If you didn&#8217;t see it, NASA put a [great video out from the Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://youtu.be/4Z9rM8ChTjY) showing the transit in multiple wavelengths. I favorited it because it is something I can show my students over the next 105 years until they get to see the next transit for themselves.
