After a horrendous start of the year (I won&#8217;t go into it here&#8230;) I was finally able to introduce the whole flipped classroom idea to my students today. They had a taste yesterday, but with the materials in hand and the technology to use, it finally began to click for many of my students.

I&#8217;m convinced that the key to handing education back to students lies in the simple act of allowing some freedom. The concept is so foreign to students that they don&#8217;t know how to react when they have freedom.

> &#8220;Can I work ahead?&#8221;
>
> &#8220;Can we work with someone else on this?&#8221;
>
> &#8220;I can use pictures to answer the questions?&#8221;

As I enthusiastically answered yes, the questions became more bold.

> &#8220;Do I have to watch _your_ videos?&#8221;
>
> &#8220;I remember how to do this&#8230;do I have to listen to this section?&#8221;

They were analyzing their prior knowledge and critically thinking about what I was asking them to do. There was creativity in their responses. They _immediately_ formed groups and began to problem solve on some of the tougher components. My students were engaged and deeply involved in the learning cycle from the start&#8230;because they had freedom.

Freedom to **make mistakes without repercussions**.

Freedom to **forge their own learning path**.

Freedom to **talk and share and collaborate**.

The best part was watching the light bulb turn on for kids that had no interest in science when they walked in the door that same day.

I can&#8217;t wait for tomorrow.
