I wanted to write this down while it&#8217;s fresh in my mind (and because it&#8217;s late).

I&#8217;m finishing a graduate semester on curriculum theory and practice and the final project I chose to complete was a redesign of a school&#8217;s curriculum. I decided to really push the boundaries and go for an all-inquiry, mixed age thematic classes. It&#8217;s a real swing from the norm. But, I think it can be done (mainly because it _is_ being done).

[Michelle Baldwin](http://www.twitter.com/michellek107) was kind enough to endure a ton of questions as I worked through some of the stickier points. Mainly, how does one lesson plan and account for mandatory standards in a school where students direct the exploration and topics for learning.

    <a href="https://twitter.com/bennettscience">@bennettscience</a> exactly. We still report on standards, but it's my job to look at what the kids are doing and figure that part out.

What happens is linked _back_ to the standard. Themes exist, but specific demonstrations come organically through exploration and play. The teacher&#8217;s job is to find those demonstrations and reconcile it with the student. Preempting the demo via planned assessment activity undermines inquiry.
