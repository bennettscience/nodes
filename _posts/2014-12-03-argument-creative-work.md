This is the final post for my Creativity in Teaching and Learning course, and it&#8217;s broken up into three parts.

## The White Paper

The first part is a [long-form essay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaOr2Cw4ubqIMpn1uWmqPPMG4lp-xl8Ni3vLRYa8LXM/edit#heading=h.5vrjyxhfefic) on the value of creativity in the classroom. It was formed by pulling together themes from <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/cep818-creativity-in-learning" target="blank">from all of my writing for the course this semester</a> and expands on some of those ideas. Think of it as a big summary about why we need to allow students to work creatively in their learning.

## The Elevator Pitch

If you&#8217;re short on time, I&#8217;ve got the elevator pitch below. It&#8217;s a condensed version of the white paper, and hits the major points of the essay. Consider it a one-minute commercial for why you should bookmark the essay to read later.

## Even Shorter

Maybe you&#8217;re on mobile and the audio doesn&#8217;t work so well. Fear not, here it is in a tweet:

    Creative work isn't just a final product. It's woven into every idea stu's play with as they learn. Important diff. <a href="http://t.co/VzhRG0aURf">http://t.co/VzhRG0aURf</a>
