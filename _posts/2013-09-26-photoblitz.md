This summer, I survived the [ds106zone](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ds106zone&src=typd). There was a creative blitz that I&#8217;ve been wanting to carry through the fall. But life ([literally](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/and-then-there-were-three/)) has come into my life, and I haven&#8217;t been able to carry the momentum.

Right now, [the ds106 community](http://www.ds106.us) is tracking through a self-inflicted &#8220;headless&#8221; course. No professor, no grades, no expectations. It&#8217;s pretty fun to watch the flow coming through Twitter, and I wanted to take a few minutes today to participate in the visual work they&#8217;re doing.

The assignment was a photoblitz: 15 minutes of photography around certain themes. I was able to do about 10 minutes here at my desk during lunch (not counting the writeup). In fact, I didn&#8217;t even stand up. It was all done from my chair on my phone, because that&#8217;s all I had with me. My five photos are below.
