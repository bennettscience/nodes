I remind my students _constantly_ that I can&#8217;t help if they don&#8217;t do one of two things: 1) Ask me a question when they&#8217;re confused, or 2) get something wrong on an assignment. I need to see their thinking, and those two methods &#8211; along with my questioning &#8211; are the best indicators of strengths and weaknesses.

Lately, it&#8217;s spiraled into something much more confounding. Students are stuck, but they refuse to ask _any_thing. Even when I give a freebie, anything-goes offer. When I come by to prompt, they admit to being stuck, but then don&#8217;t do the small task to get _un_stuck. So there they remain. And nothing gets done.

And so we spiral.

It&#8217;s hyperbole, but I think they feel like kids in the car in Jurassic Park when I come by.

The fear of being wrong &#8211; searching for the right answer every time &#8211; is something I&#8217;ve tried to combat all year long, but it&#8217;s still got hold of most of my students. So many are afraid to be wrong, that they&#8217;re paralyzed and can&#8217;t take the help, even when offered outright. It&#8217;s a safety thing&#8230;I don&#8217;t know if they don&#8217;t feel safe because of my teaching style or because of peers&#8230;but it&#8217;s something that needs to be worked out somehow.

How do you help students get over the initial hump of just asking a question? Even if it&#8217;s something as simple as, &#8220;What&#8217;s the charge of a proton?&#8221; A small door like that would allow me to build their confidence and point to small, accomplishable tasks which will help them progress on their own.
