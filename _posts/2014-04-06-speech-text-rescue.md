Have you ever tried to read an article or paper but gotten so bogged down with the vocabulary that you didn&#8217;t understand what was going on? This happens to students every single day in schools, and especially to ESL, ELL, or reading disabled children. There is evidence showing that this is due to an overload on their working memory and can be addressed with some simple interventions in the classroom and with therapy outside the class.

Chrome Extensions are a _great_ way to improve the web, including speech-to-text. I used them in my teaching to help students focus on the context of the entire article and not necessarily on the vocabulary on it&#8217;s own. What I saw was an improvement in comprehension and summarization of the text as well as a more open approach to scientific literature.

You can read the [full Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cysV0rmrH-IaVkX5RNQDM_0waUT9hKk59G8vgALFbmM/edit?usp=sharing) and, as always, comments are welcome.
