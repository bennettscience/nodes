I&#8217;ve been ensconced in Chrome lately. I worked with the team at TechSmith who brought Snagit to Chrome and now, I&#8217;m researching different ways to make learning more accessible through Chrome apps and extensions. I&#8217;m not going to get into the argument of why it is or isn&#8217;t a big deal. I&#8217;ll just say that yes, I think it is a big deal, but save the why for another post.

Last night, Google published an extension that brings Google Now-like voice searching to Chrome. It runs in the background and lets you use the &#8220;OK Google&#8221; trigger to search for anything.

You should [grab the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-voice-search-hotwo/bepbmhgboaologfdajaanbcjmnhjmhfn) to try it yourself.



Like I said in the video, other than feeling like I&#8217;m in Star Trek, talking to my computer and having it talk back, what implications does this have for learning? If students can do a search for _anything_ without even using their hands, it should really change the way we think about technology in classrooms.

What ideas do you have?
