</div>As I was walking back to my classroom this afternoon, I passed a couple of learners in the hall talking about their grades. I don&#8217;t have either of these individuals in my class, nor do I know what class they were discussing, but that is beside the point.

What stuck in my head is when the girl said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to look at my grade&#8230;I don&#8217;t even want to know.&#8221;

I began to wonder if kids talk about my class that way. How am I using grades? Are they punitive and discouraging, or is it a report of current progress in the class? I would hope that it is the latter, but I&#8217;m not sure.

Something to chew on.
