Monday, September 10th is the 25th weekly #flipclass chat. After [beginning back in March](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/flipclass-chat-starts-with-a-bang/), we have had a great team of moderators form and had increased participation on a weekly basis.

[<img class="alignleft" title="Panasonic AG-HVX200" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/48/108616724_2e8e529336_n.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="213" />](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/48/108616724_2e8e529336_n.jpg)One thing we discovered this summer was that live discussions using Goole+ Hangouts On-Air were a great way to bring in experts in flipping from all over the world to discuss best practice and give tips on how flipping works for them. Stories are one of the best tools for learning, and we want to continue to embrace your stories.

For this broadcast, we&#8217;re going to highlight classroom norms that work well for us. The beginning of the school year is a time where we get to know kids and learn about our class cultures, but it is also a time to build good habits and set community expectations. When you change the way you think about teaching and learning, that process can become very difficult. We&#8217;re hoping to give a broad view of teachers who want to share what norms work for them. At the same time, we&#8217;re all looking to learn some new tools from others.

While we can&#8217;t all spend time together in the hangout, the audience will have an active role in the discussion. After brief introductions, I will serve as the voice of Twitter to the panel to encourage some Q&A and continued discussion.
