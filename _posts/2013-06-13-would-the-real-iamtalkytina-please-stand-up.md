My schedule has been picking up like crazy, and I&#8217;m afraid this may be my last [ds106](http://www.ds106.us) post for the summer semester. Maybe I can get one or two more assignments in, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen.

That being said, it&#8217;s time to clear the air.

I know [Alan posted that he is the creator of @IAmTalkyTina](http://cogdogblog.com/2013/06/12/i-am-iamtalkytina/), but I&#8217;m here to set the record straight.

As I was getting into ds106, [Ben Rimes](http://www.twitter.com/techsavvyed) was telling me about all of the role playing and storytelling that happened within the narrative of the course. I _loved_ that it spilled over into the online interactions, so I thought setting up a ds106 character right from the beginning based on the Twilight Zone would help me get right into the swing of things.

So, officially, I am the creator and running of [@IAmTalkyTina](http://www.twitter.com/iamtalkytina). She isn&#8217;t going to disappear, although my work will&#8230;there are still some twists in the ds106zone Talky Tina story. Keep your eyes out.[](http://www.twitter.com/iamtalkytina) I&#8217;m still watching you&#8230;

Ben, I&#8217;m sorry if you&#8217;ve lost some sleep over me, but I sure had fun scaring the pants off you once or twice. I hope we can still be friends&#8230;
