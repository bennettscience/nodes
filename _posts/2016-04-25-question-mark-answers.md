We played Jeopardy today in class (with some major upsets coming during final Jeopardy&#8230;quite exciting) to review atoms and the periodic table organization. It&#8217;s a super-short chapter that sets up a foundation for bonding, naming, and chemical reactions. It&#8217;s also nice because it&#8217;s _mostly_ review (or should be) of 8th grade physical science.

There&#8217;s still new stuff I throw at them, like valence electron location and Bohr model electron shells.

During Jeopardy, I try to give thought-provoking questions to get students to see patterns and interconnections between ideas. A favorite line of mine is, &#8220;There are only _so_ many ways I can ask these questions.&#8221; This is painfully obvious as we go through more games and skill building activities.

I started to see a lot of:

> neutrons?

> valence?

> 2 shells and 3 valence?

on the whiteboards.

I _love_ the question mark. Sure, I&#8217;d love it if they were confident and could just spout some of this stuff (because it makes the rest of the year much, much easier to digest). But, I&#8217;m more happy that we&#8217;re finally approaching a point of being willing to venture logical responses rather than, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;

It was also super fun to see the excitement when a ventured answer was, believe it or not, correct.

And it only took until April 25th. Maybe next year, we can hit this on April 24th. I&#8217;ll call that a win.
