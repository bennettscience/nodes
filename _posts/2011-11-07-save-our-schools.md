Last weekend I had the privilege of attending EdCamp: Grand Rapids hosted by the extraordinary [Ron Houtman](http://www.twitter.com/ronhoutman). About 100 educators from all over Michigan (and a couple from Indiana) came together to talk about current education practice, major shifts in policy, and pretty much anything else under the sun.

At the conference I had the chance to listen to [Ira Socol](http://www.twitter.com/irasocol) lead a discussion on his views of technology in schools today. While Ira and I don&#8217;t agree very much on some ideas about technology, we both agree that technology should not be implemented in blanket fashion across the board.

I tweeted this during the session:

I rarely include my own tweets in my blog posts, but I&#8217;ve really been thinking about this a lot since Saturday.

Ira is 100% correct in the fact that schools should **not** be spending thousands of dollars on blanket technology integration plans if there is no meaningful technology training plan that comes with it. School leaders are investing in technology to save their schools rather than investing in a competent, professional, highly-supported and highly-trained staff to implement the use technology effectively. I think the most egregious example of this is the rise [and fall] of interactive white boards. With tablet availability and handheld power in each of our learner&#8217;s hands, what is happening with these boards that are supposed to revolutionize our teaching? Nothing. They hang on the wall as the world&#8217;s most expensive piece of whitespace.

The problem isn&#8217;t with the technology. Technology is a thing&#8230;it can&#8217;t help or save a school. For that matter, it can&#8217;t make a school fail. What it _can_ do is give teachers a chance to do something better than they used to. But, in order for that to happen, the leaders in our school systems _have_ to recognize that meaningful and innovative use of technology _only_ comes with the proper professional development and investment in staff learning resources.

I am not the first person to write about this, nor will I be the last. But, as we move into a more technological society and a more polarized society over education, we as teachers and administrators _must_ recognize that an investment in technology only has supplemental value. The innovation that technology is so often heralded for for is already in the building, waiting for its investment.
