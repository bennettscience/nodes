The first week of [ds106](http://www.ds106.us) is coming to a close, and I needed to finish my [design](http://assignments.ds106.us/types/designassignments/) work for the week. I clicked on &#8220;try a random assignment&#8221; and got the [D&D Monster Manual](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/dds106-monster-manual/) assignment. I&#8217;ve never played [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons), but the imagination and storytelling that go into the game are very attractive. (On a side note, if you&#8217;re near South Bend, I&#8217;d love to learn how to play some time.)

As [Ben Rimes](http://www.twitter.com/techsavvyed) is 100% responsible for introducing me to ds106, it was only fitting that he become my monster.

This project took me a long time because the mage I pulled was just a line drawing. I also had to re-learn how to select out different parts of the image as layers to get clean colors. To add to the complexity, I had to play with the fill opacity and style to get the grainy look. I&#8217;m not 100% happy with the color in the lettering, but it would have been too hard to read if I had done it lighter. Finally, GIMP&#8217;s fonts aren&#8217;t so wonderful. But, GIMP does tie into my Mac&#8217;s system fonts, so I went online and grabbed [one for the front](http://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Uncategorized/45490/Souvenir_Gothic_Becker_Ant_Demi) from [fonts101.com](http://www.fonts101.com), and Dosis for the back from Google&#8217;s [Web Font](http://www.google.com/fonts/) repository. Both free, both now living on my computer for use whenever I want.

The story part was a lot of fun. I had to do a lot of research into how D&D actually works with monsters (and I&#8217;m still not sure I got it right), but thinking up how it would act based on how I know Ben was a fun extension. There&#8217;s probably also some kind of backstory in there that I might come back to some day.

If you want to grab the .xcf files, here&#8217;s the front, and then the reverse.
