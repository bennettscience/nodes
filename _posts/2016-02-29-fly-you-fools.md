This semester, a few classes asked for bi-weekly review over the entire year so they can keep old material fresh. I was really happy to get these requests because it shows a higher level of maturity than I&#8217;ve seen lately and that they recognize that old stuff still applies.

[State testing starts this week](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/dont-call-it-a-sheep/) (blargh) so I decided to use Friday and today to do some review over forces with a paper airplane challenge.

We spent some time discussing balanced and unbalanced forces, what causes acceleration, and what forces might be acting on a moving aircraft. Then, I tasked groups of three with building aircraft that would 1) fly really far, and 2) stay in the air for a long time. It&#8217;s tough to do because you can either go [right for the glide](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-the-BEST-Paper-Stunt-PlaneGlider/) or shoot for something that handles [projectile motion](http://www.instructables.com/id/Insanely-fast-paper-plane/) a little more effectively for increased distance.

Most groups split the difference with an in-between design which led to pretty consistent success on both counts.

The lab isn&#8217;t perfect. There are things I&#8217;ll change for next year. It would be great in the forces unit, but I think I&#8217;ll keep it as review because 1) it&#8217;s a good break up of the monotony, _especially_ in testing season, and 2) we can apply material immediately rather than slogging through principles.

Plus, it&#8217;s hard to be discouraged with the state of education when you hear cheers about a paper gliding for 20+ meters down the hallway.
