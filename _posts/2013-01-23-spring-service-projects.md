This spring, I&#8217;m asking my homeroom students to perform some type of service project. The type of project is up to them, but I&#8217;ve encouraged them to think as locally as they can. Whether that&#8217;s the school or the neighborhood they live in doesn&#8217;t matter to me.

I have a couple that already have ideas to build off of, but I&#8217;d love to see some other types of projects that were successful. If you have some examples (or know people with examples), I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback on the form embedded below.
