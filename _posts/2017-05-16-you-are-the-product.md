The *New York Times* profiled Google&#8217;s [rush into education](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/technology/google-education-chromebooks-schools.html) over the last eight years in a long piece this weekend. Some initial thoughts:

&#8211; The value behind the &#8220;Innovative Educator&#8221; title is completely created by Google. There is no value other than the fact that a company says it has value.

&#8211; Skills in a platform &#8211; even a cloud platform &#8211; are important, but not removed from the content students are supposed to be learning.

&#8211; If you don&#8217;t pay for it, you are the product being sold. Even if advertising isn&#8217;t *targeted* to students in GSuite, when you roll that data into a consumer account, it&#8217;s all there, ripe for auction.

&#8211; The marketization of education is pervasive and can erode the purpose of education: the holistic growth of students in all areas. Allowing companies like Google (among others) to direct what &#8220;good education&#8221; looks like is dangerous.

be careful what you buy into. Everything Google has done over the last decade in education is not altruistic. There is a company mission which drives all decisions and being aware of how those impact users is important.
