_I wrote this as a post to a discussion forum for grad school. It seemed fitting to post on the blog as well. It's a response to a children's story called ['The Rag Coat'](https://www.amazon.com/Rag-Coat-Lauren-Mills/dp/0316574074), in which a poor girl's coat made of rags tells stories about everyone around her._

I'm not really a journaler; I do blog regularly, but it usually isn't about life stuff. But, I always have a notebook with me. It's a habit I picked up from student teaching, mainly for doing quick reflections on lessons I taught or observations of my host teacher. She really helped me establish a habit of reflection that started with pen and paper. Every year since then, I usually go through a full notebook.

They've become unofficial journals; memories elucidated by lesson plan ideas, to-do lists, and trip packing lists. I can pinpoint the spot in a notebook from 2013 when we moved back to the United States from South Korea. I'm reminded about recommendation letters I wrote for students who are now out of college (and some with kids of their own!)

There's the notebook where the writing switches abruptly from a large project brainstorm to HR managers after I lost a job unexpectedly.

There's a notebook with baby nursery lists as we got ready for each of our daughters.

Writing things down - even little things - has become my norm. It helps me connect with teachers, who see me as the "tech guy," when they wonder why I still have paper and pen on hand. It bridges gaps caused by fear and apprehension of change.

I'm looking forward to finishing this year's notes.
