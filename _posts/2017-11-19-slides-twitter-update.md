A short update to my post about tweeting Google Slides presentations after some work this weekend.

&#8211; Working AddOn menu prototyped.

&#8211; Check if a user is logged into Twitter on launch. If not, log them in.

&#8211; The user can append a hashtag to each slide. This is stored in each presentation until the user changes the input.

&#8211; The custom player now launches in a pared-down popup rather than a new tab.

&#8211; Scrolling enabled/disabled.

&#8211; Each slide is posted on advance (slide 1 posted when you move to slide 2) to buy a little time (still laggy).

## to do:

1. Improve the connect to Twitter flow.

2. Work to improve the tweet posting time.

3. Confirmation popup when a tweet is posted successfully.

4. Error handling when a tweet fails to post for some reason.
