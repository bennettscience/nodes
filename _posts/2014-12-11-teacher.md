I&#8217;m really struggling. I lost my job in November and I&#8217;m in the midst of trying to balance what I do with who I am.

<a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/straddling-the-line/" target="blank">I wrote in January</a> about the confusion I feel with identity. It&#8217;s even bigger now, with more questions than answers. [Bill Ferriter](http://www.twitter.com/plugusin) was kind enough to leave a [very wise comment](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/straddling-the-line/#comment-1193005723) for me:

> I definitely think there&#8217;s an expiration date for people who walk away from the classroom &#8212; both in your own ability to understand just what it means to be a real-live bona fide full time classroom teacher and in your ability to maintain credibility as a practitioner in the eyes of those of us who are still in the classroom.
> 
> That&#8217;s unavoidable. It is what it is.
> 
> Your challenge is reminding yourself that your work still carries value. In many ways, you get to empower teachers now in ways that you could never do before. It&#8217;s a different kind of rewarding, but it is still rewarding, none the less.

(That&#8217;s just a snippet, but it helps.)

<a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/sages-lunatics-teacher-identity/" target="blank">In May, I wrote more</a> about _being_ a teacher&#8230;what it means for identity and working. I still think that a teacher is a holistic undertaking &#8211; you don&#8217;t _do_ teaching. You _are_ a teacher. It&#8217;s unique in the sense that not many other professions can make the same claim.

I think I had it right back in January &#8211; I need to stop defining myself by one quality. I may not be in a classroom, my expiration date may be past, but I&#8217;m inextricably wound up in education, regardless of what I do. Maybe that&#8217;s the real lesson.
