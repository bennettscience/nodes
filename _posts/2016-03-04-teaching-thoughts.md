Some things I&#8217;m thinking through this week, written here so I can find them later.

&#8211; [Evan Weinberg](//www.twitter.com/emwdx) has a good string of posts on his blog related to student assessment. [This one in particular](http://evanweinberg.com/2016/02/25/standards-based-grading-streamlining-assessments/) has me thinking through 1) what I assess, 2) how I&#8217;m assessing, and 3) what information I _actually_ get from students on the assessment.

&#8211; I really struggle with setting consistent classroom expectations, which has led to a lot of the frustrations I&#8217;m dealing with in class.

&#8211; My instruction, even though I often call it &#8220;student centered,&#8221; is still too focused on me.

&#8211; But I&#8217;m not sure, because of the two items above in conjunction, that I&#8217;ve moved my students to a place where they can be self-directed more often.

&#8211; The influence of standardized testing on our students is increasingly negative and I need to keep a positive attitude during the testing windows even though I&#8217;m incredibly frustrated.

&#8211; I need to make consistent time to either code or read, because those have helped me relax more than anything else these days.
