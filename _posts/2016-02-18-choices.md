Before I dive in, I think [Justin Aion](http://www.twitter.com/justinaion) and I are parallels of one another in the multiverse. [His day](http://blog.relearningtoteach.com/2016/02/day-103-loud-noises.html?spref=tw) was similar to mine.

&#8212;

Six weeks into this semester, I have three of six classes with averages in the 50% range. Some of those classes include students with sub 30% grades. Most of it is from choosing not to engage in any way, shape or form. I&#8217;ve tried blanket policies. I&#8217;ve tried meeting in the middle. I&#8217;ve tried strategy after strategy to no avail in some cases.

So I sat down with each class and asked them what to do.

Five of my six classes had _fantastic_ conversations about the choices that have been made. We&#8217;ve talked about why we come to school, what the purpose of the class is, why I do what I do&#8230;it was much more insightful than I expected. But, there was still business to attend to.

Most classes came up with conduct agreements that we all signed (students added their names to a Google doc which I then printed and signed) and are now hanging up on the wall as a reminder of what we&#8217;ve all agreed to. It includes things like:

&#8211; One day each week to go over the week&#8217;s stuff to make sure we&#8217;re all on the same page.

&#8211; Group roles (similar to POGIL) to be used _any_ time group work is being done, not just special tasks.

&#8211; An actual tray to turn papers in to, not just the corner of the lab bench.

&#8211; An actual dedicated place to find extra copies of stuff (rather than relying on me).

And then the elephant: phones.

They&#8217;ve been a problem for the majority of my students. Some classes more than others. Most agreed to a Phone Jail system where the phone goes when it&#8217;s reached the limit. They came up with particular infractions which will be self policed (that&#8217;s the idea anyways). I&#8217;m the final say in Phone Jail.

I&#8217;m trying to keep it lighthearted. They know when they&#8217;re distracted, I think calling it out with something silly/serious like Phone Jail will help.

All in all, I think they were healthy conversations that helped us all understand each other a little better.

&#8212;

Then, The Class Who Chose Not To Choose.

I prompted, they were silent. They came up with, &#8220;You need to be more strict&#8221; and &#8220;Just kick people out.&#8221;

Another asked, &#8220;Dude, why are you asking kids how to do _your_ job?&#8221;

That was a good one.

It&#8217;s sad that our culture is one in which students can&#8217;t imagine a better way to work together. I&#8217;m the teacher. They&#8217;re the students. What I say goes (unless they disagree with it, of course).

I made it very clear that their indecision and unwillingness to work with me meant lockdown. No phones, no freedoms to choose seats&#8230;nothing. I was met with silence. When we got to work and I gave two students a phone warning&#8230;well, you can imagine how that went.

&#8212;

Changing culture takes time. I have to remind myself that it&#8217;s a multi-year process. I&#8217;m blessed that the majority of my classes are willing to _try_ and address culture shifts. It&#8217;s jarring when one group of very talented people choose not to take that step of faith.
