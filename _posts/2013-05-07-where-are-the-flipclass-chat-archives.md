I had a minor site reorganization, and I wanted to make sure everyone who relies on the chat archive each week knows how to find it. There are a couple different ways:

1. **This blog** &#8211; The page hasn&#8217;t been updated in a long time, but there is a link the archives under the [Flipclass Chat](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/flipclass-chat/) page in the header. The archive is now sorted by year to help keep everything straight.

[<img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/link.png" alt="flipclass chat link header blog" width="893" height="156" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1998" srcset="https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/link.png 893w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/link-300x52.png 300w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/link-100x17.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" />](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/link.png)

2. **The Twitters** &#8211; I do my best to make sure the archive is out ASAP the following morning, so you can check the [#flipclass hashtag search](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23flipclass&src=typd) (you can do this even if you&#8217;re not on Twitter) and find the link there. If you are on Twitter, be sure to [follow me](http://www.twitter.com/bennettscience) to receive updates directly each week.

3. **Right here** &#8211; Just for good measure, [here is another link](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B7UphN8boIo2cXVoWGx1MFNSeGlscGotUmVDRGo2Zw/edit) to the folders, so you don&#8217;t have to go hunting.

**Remember, the chat is every Monday night at 8PM EST, 5PM PST.** You can also find more information over on the [Flipped Learning Journal](http://www.flippedlearningjournal.org/flipclass-chat.html).
