This is kind of a long story, but stick with me, because I&#8217;m excited about it.

## Introduction

Earlier this year, I set a goal for myself to learn Python. I started on learning, but I didn&#8217;t really have any practical application for what I was doing.

## Rising Action

I&#8217;ve always enjoyed astronomy, looking at the stars and planets, and more recently, trying to take pictures of them in my back yard.

I&#8217;m planning on buying a telescope in the near future, and part of that is going to include a simple motor to make sure I can aim it accurately and efficiently.

I&#8217;m also starting a master&#8217;s class in a couple weeks at MSU which is focusing on the maker culture idea and its implications in the classroom. Rather than purchasing a textbook for the course, we&#8217;ve been asked to buy a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Makey Makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/), [Squishy Circuits Kit](http://squishycircuitsstore.com/kits.html), or a [LittleBits](http://littlebits.com/kits) kit. 

And that&#8217;s when I had my stroke of insight. (I won&#8217;t be presumptuous and say genius. Yet.)

My project this fall is going to be going back and actually learning [Python](http://www.python.org) to create a program on the Raspberry Pi which can be used to control my telescope.

After doing some searching, I even found a Python library, <a href=http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/index.html">PyEphem</a>, which is a database of astronomical data put together (in part) by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. [Those are the guys that landed Curiosity on Mars](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/index.php?id=1103). They know what they&#8217;re doing.

I know this is going to be a crazy six weeks of learning, working, and applying that to the classroom. While working full time. And raising my daughter.

Bring it on.

## The Conflict

I&#8217;ve already started by looking back at the Python I&#8217;d already learned to see if I could begin to tap into what I&#8217;ve already found. I&#8217;ve got a public [Github repository](https://github.com/TSCBennett/astro) to hold all of the code as I write. Right now, it&#8217;s five lines of code that allow you to pick a planet and a date (even a future date&#8230;awesome) and it will tell you which constellation the planet appears in. 

If you&#8217;ve got experience with Python, I&#8217;d really love to have your input as I go through the process. 

I&#8217;m not expecting to have this totally done by the end of the semester, but I know I&#8217;m going to be learning a _ton_ that I&#8217;ll be able to take back to the classroom someday.
