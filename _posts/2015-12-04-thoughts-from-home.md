My wife had our second daughter last week. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be able to stay home with them this week and help out with the newborn and our two year old.

In the in-between times, usually late at night, I&#8217;d think about school stuff. In no particular order:

  * I don&#8217;t do a good job recognizing culture in my classroom.
  * I also don&#8217;t do a good job of having performance evaluations for students. Work is limited to the scope I set.
  * At the same time, I don&#8217;t have a good way to have students access outside content. Many have devices, but many don&#8217;t.
  * We&#8217;re moving into chemistry soon and finding those connections are difficult.
  * I don&#8217;t want to give multiple choice tests anymore, but I have to stick with the other teachers in the department with the same course. So, how do I evaluate differently but maintain parity?
  * When issues with ed tech are brought up, people take it really, really personally (I&#8217;m included there).
  * Sometimes those personal feelings get in the way of good decisions (yep. Still including myself).
