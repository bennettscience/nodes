I&#8217;m on bath duty each night. After dinner, the water runs, and Meredith gets really, really excited. The tub is full of boat, plastic chains, and foam letters which have a great feature of sticking to the wall when they&#8217;re wet. I&#8217;ve even discovered that, if thrown just right, they will stick on their own. 

I don&#8217;t want to humblebrag, but I can get it to stick one out of seven attempts.

I managed to get a &#8220;G&#8221; to stick tonight and I started wondering why it stuck to the wall&#8230;is it cohesion or adhesion?

I&#8217;m still thinking through how to best explain this&#8230;which force is more prevalent? **Is** is one more powerful than the others?

When I taught adhesion and cohesion, never considered a problem like this&#8230;they were all straight forward because I had to assess the standard. I was afraid of confusing them. Now, I&#8217;m more afraid of what I missed because I _didn&#8217;t_ confuse them.

How would you explain the picture? What would your students say?
