I&#8217;ve been working very hard this year to make sure students experience science &#8211; or the process of science &#8211; as much as possible. Physics and chemistry are _real_ and they matter to us. It&#8217;s my job to help them see _why_ they matter to us.

Placed into a school context, I ask students to prove that they&#8217;ve learned something. I grade based on standards with a very simple standards-based method (based largely on [Frank Noschese&#8217;s](http://www.twitter.com/fnoschese) [writing](https://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/keep-it-simple-standards-based-grading/)): if you know it, full credit. If you don&#8217;t know it, no credit. I don&#8217;t fuss with percentages or sliding scales. The objectives (standards has a different connotation to students, more on that another time) weight in at 80% of their final grade. I still give tests and quizzes which can demonstrate the learning, but students are free to show me what they know at any time for credit.

I&#8217;ve run into an issue where students memorize snippets in hopes of earning the objective. It&#8217;s a checkbox to them. I&#8217;m trying to show that learning is more than the simple recitation of information. It&#8217;s the sum of the experiences and, more importantly, what you _do_ with those experiences.

I get this way every time I give a quiz or test because I have to constantly reiterate the importance of learning, not just in &#8220;passing.&#8221;
