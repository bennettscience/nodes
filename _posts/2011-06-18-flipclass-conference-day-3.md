Unfortunately, I need to leave the conference early today, so I&#8217;m writing before I hop on an airplane for a few hours.  

There is some great stuff being shared again and the attendees are much more vocal with their ideas and thoughts as they get more confident with the ideas we&#8217;re trying to present.

I got drafted this morning to put a video together today highlighting some teachers as they think through some things they&#8217;re going to be doing.  It is very inspirational to me (as a presenter) to see people _excited_ about the prospects of turning their classrooms around.  And, it isn&#8217;t even all teachers here.  There are technology directors, district-level employees, and other here that aren&#8217;t in the classroom but are committed to improving their methods.  You can watch the video in a pop-up player here or you can watch it on YouTube.

Right now, my presentations are sort of all over the place, and I will be working on consolidating them all on my Learn page. I&#8217;ll tweet it out when everything is consolidated for sure.

If you were at the conference, thank you SO MUCH for all of the discussion, encouragement, and inspiration you&#8217;ve given me this week. Please always feel free to write or comment because we need to continue the collaboration.
