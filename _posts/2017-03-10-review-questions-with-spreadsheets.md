I wanted to use a new method of reviewing with students as we wrap up our cell activity unit. I&#8217;ve been working with my students on [forming questions](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/improving-questions-1) with the [question formulation strategy](http://hepg.org/hel-home/issues/27_5/helarticle/teaching-students-to-ask-their-own-questions_507) around content as well as finding new ways to build content knowledge resources. We&#8217;re at the point in the year where details are more and more significant and we connect (seemingly) disconnected ideas.

I threw together [a template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaAbdpp_DwdWzsizE3PWjiZUBBBdHCmBRb7zSBL-HVY/edit#gid=0) ([click to make a copy for yourself](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaAbdpp_DwdWzsizE3PWjiZUBBBdHCmBRb7zSBL-HVY/edit#gid=0)) in Drive and then assigned students to groups. Using [Doctopus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doctopus/ffhegaddkjpkfiemhhnphmnadfbkdhbf?hl=en) (life changing&#8230;really), I was able to give each group a blank template. Their task was to come up with review questions on anything they&#8217;d like from this section.

The next layer was to have the groups look at their original questions and revamp them into something that is AP Biology-worthy. Groups that do this well will have their questions included on the test.

I noticed three things:

1. Critical review by individual students. The questions they asked _me_ underscored misconceptions present. I was able to work them through _why_ the right answer was right and where they needed to correct their understanding.

2. Competition amongst groups to ask better questions was high. I didn&#8217;t promise only one question included, so there is a high desire to write really good questions. Group members worked together to revise and strengthen their questions.

3. Writing questions that really check for _understanding_ is difficult. It&#8217;s easy to write a really hard questions. It&#8217;s much more difficult to write a question that checks for understanding. Students recognize that the questions I design and ask are very specific for a reason. They&#8217;re going through the same process.

In the future, I would build some kind of dashboard to aggregate the questions and look them over as a class, but with time short, I think this is a good first pass.

How would you build or extend this? What am I missing?
