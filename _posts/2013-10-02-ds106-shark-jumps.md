It was one of those days, and I couldn&#8217;t pass this one up. 

The Headless ds106 is in full swing, and this week is Design Week. I _love_ design work because it makes me think hard about how to communicate ideas both subtly and artfully. You can see [some of my design work](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/tag/designassignments/) from the Twilight Zone theme this past summer.

Earlier today, [Rochelle Lockridge](http://www.twitter.com/rockylou22) posted an article in which someone (a colleague?) created an animated GIF for a presentation they were doing for work. This animation is great (and probably beyond my own GIMP chops) and it was a cool story to see them work through the struggle to learn GIMP to produce the image.

Later, [Alan](http://www.twitter.com/cogdog) posted this tweet:

And BOOM. Sharks? Complicated animated GIFs of technical thingywhosits? I got to work.

I give you: &#8220;Make the shark jump you.&#8221;

In ds106, we don&#8217;t jump the shark. That bad boy jumps us.

Go make art.
