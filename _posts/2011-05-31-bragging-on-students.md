I love opportunities to brag on students that do some great work.  As often as I can, I&#8217;ll send something in to Twitter or other teachers in our school.  It&#8217;s always great sending something out, but it&#8217;s even better when it is a student that blindsides you with an amazing project&#8230;and that happened to me today.

I assigned a research project where students picked _any_ topic, as long as it related to chemistry.  They chose three essential questions and then did a project sharing what they learned.  A lot of students build a Blogger site or a Wix page, and some did powerpoint presentations in front of a small group of students.  Others chose to do videos, and the video I&#8217;ve linked below from a student really blew me away with its simplicity and the personality of the student that comes through.

Take a couple minutes to watch these&#8230;I&#8217;d love to be able to pass some comments along to this student about her work.
