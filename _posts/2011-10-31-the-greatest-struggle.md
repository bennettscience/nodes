I went to Kentucky this weekend to visit my parents. It was a great weekend and I&#8217;m glad I was able to spend some time away from thinking about teaching or grading. We all need refreshers&#8230;make sure you take them periodically.

When I returned home Sunday afternoon, I had a stack of exams waiting to be graded. We have just finished a chapter on biomolecules (proteins, carbs, lipids, etc) and I gave a test to check their understanding. Typically, I give a few multiple choice as a quick check over some basic content, but the rest of the test is written, applied knowledge that asks for reasoning and defense. The questions are open-ended and allow for varied responses based on their interests and personal growth.

These tests had more blanks in responses that I have ever seen. Needless to say, I was pretty frustrated with the results. I finished the grading, threw the number at the top of the page, and put them away. Where had I gone wrong? They got it in class when we played games or discussed&#8230;why the disconnect?

  Fast forward to Monday morning. I saw this tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/buddyxo">Stacy Roshan</a> when I got to school:

I love the [RSA Animate video](http://youtu.be/zDZFcDGpL4U) of Sir Ken Robinson&#8217;s talk. I watched it earlier this year, but I went back and watched it again. My problem is that I&#8217;m continuing to teach and assess in linear fashions. I have missed the inherent genetics of learning.

Learning is not linear. Learning is not prescribed. Learning _cannot_ be pigeonholed into separate chunks of discrete knowledge that are measured by tests alone.

Learning is dirty. Learning is exciting. Learning _should_ be personalized, varied, and integrated.

The greatest struggle I have is changing my _own_ teaching paradigm, not getting kids to write on a test. I try to challenge myself to think outside of my box of training, but I still struggle to actually _work_ outside the box. We are doing a disservice to learners by continuing to test and use those scores as gauges of their learning. My kids didn&#8217;t fill out my test because it was boring&#8230;it didn&#8217;t ask for relevance and it certainly didn&#8217;t give any chance for creativity.

Do they get a free pass on this one? No. I need to correct my mistakes, but learners also need to recognize the fact that leaving a blank does not help the situation. We&#8217;ll spend some time remediating and then move forward.

So, how do we reconcile the dichotomy? I have no idea. I am still responsible for preparing them for the state exam in May&#8230;but, I am not going to worry so much about the single exams. It is a struggle and it is the reality of education today. But if we give up and give in, then we&#8217;re not helping anybody in the long run.
