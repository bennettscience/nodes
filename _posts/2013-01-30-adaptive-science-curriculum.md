I&#8217;ve been following [Dan Meyer](http://www.twitter.com/ddmeyer) for about 15 months. I don&#8217;t teach math, but the way he talks about teaching math makes me want to teach it. If you&#8217;re not familiar with his writing and development of [Three Act Math](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=10285), you should read the linked post and go check out [his site](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?cat=95) dedicated to free materials.

Recently, he&#8217;s moved into developing web-based &#8220;textbooks,&#8221; if they can even be called that. Essentially, he&#8217;s taking intuitive knowledge of math (draw a square) and then directing the user through the process of either confirming their previous understanding or correcting their misconceptions. What really caught my attention was this [activity on squares](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=15729). Stop reading now, check it out.

Dan teamed up with a teacher/programmer named Dave Major (who also wrote a post about the squares activity). I really began to think about how this could be done in science.

Flipped Learning is all over the web. I use it, my friends use it, and we&#8217;ve all seen some amazing things happen in our classes. Honestly, I think video is reaching a point where it can help move us into meaningful digital learning spaces, but it isn&#8217;t enough. We all know that.

I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how to move content into adaptive digital environments, much like the Better Best Squares activity. [PhET simulations](http://phet.colorado.edu) by UC Boulder are a good first step, but there is still a disconnect between the task (usually paper based) and how the student interacts with the program.

I&#8217;m wondering how we can begin to make responsive programs like the squares example for science. One thought, initially, is that simulation parameters could be set by a student, much like the square they draw. Every following step would be A) integrated with the class responses, and B) based on the initial setup. 

How else could we do this in science? Are there any programmers that would be interested in trying to build some kind of pilot program? Any teachers that would be interested in writing curriculum for this project? Let me know in the comments.
