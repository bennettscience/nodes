Leading up to the headless ds106 planned for this fall, it&#8217;s an [August GIF-a-thon](http://iamtalkytina.com/2013/08/the-august-animated-gif-challenge/). I managed to find some time tonight to get one finished and uploaded.

What you see below is a reconstruction of what _really happened_. We were able to get to the doctor in time to reduce the chance of major scarring. Today, you can barely even tell this occurred.

<div style="max-width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://ohheybrian.com/images/baseball.gif"><img alt="We reduced the scarring with quick action." src="http://ohheybrian.com/images/baseball.gif" width="550" height="410" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Don&#8217;t lose your head. It isn&#8217;t worth it.
  </p>
</div>

The GIF is 11 frames long, which keeps its size pretty low. I also varied the length of each frame to give the illusion of the ball flying back at my face much faster than I threw it to Peter, because that&#8217;s what happened IRL. What a punk.
