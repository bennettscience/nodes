Some more, mostly unfiltered thoughts on badging programs run at the K12 level. ([Initial thoughts for some background](https://blog.ohheybrian.com/2017/03/badges-we-might-want-to-think-about-stinking-badges/) from back in August.)

&#8211; Articles and websites announcing badge initiatives at K12 peaked in 2014-2015. I haven&#8217;t found many articles from the last two years.

&#8211; Many (seem to have) started with schools who had a high level of teacher buy-in for PD to begin with. Building the drive for development took place before badges were introduced.

&#8211; Most of the programs started as a way to (seemingly) expose teachers to different software and programs they can use.

&#8211; Very few of the programs required evidence of implementation _along side reflection on implementation_. Most implementation evidences were photos or videos of you using the app/program/thing with students.

&#8211; No site talks about benefits for completion other than being given a [adjective] digital sticker!

I&#8217;m not convinced badging/credentialing is a bust. I&#8217;m more convinced that programs that offer long-lasting value for teaching staff are elusive and take careful planning. It&#8217;s also apparent that consistent implementation through support and updated offerings is difficult. Having a staff who is able to meet the shifting needs of a district over multiple years is key. It&#8217;s also going to be important to have a very clear mechanism for evaluation of change in instruction because _that&#8217;s_ the component that benefits students.
