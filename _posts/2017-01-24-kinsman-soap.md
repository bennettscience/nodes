My family has a heart for the refugee crisis. We&#8217;ve researched how we can help Syrians, in particular, fleeing civil war find their way to the United States. Unfortunately, Indiana has some of the most restrictive regulations in place in terms of bringing in or facilitating the arrival of refugees.

[Kinsman soap](http://www.preemptivelove.org/kinsman) is run by the Preemptive Love Coalition as a way to support refugees who cannot make it somewhere safer. We received gifts of soap made by men and women who haven&#8217;t been home in years. This is our small way of helping from a distance.

If you&#8217;d like to know more about the organization, check out their website at [www.preemptivelove.org/kinsman](http://www.preemptivelove.org/kinsman).
