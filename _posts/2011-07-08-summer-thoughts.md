It is the morning of July 8th and I just now have time to sit down with some coffee and put some thoughts down that have been flying through my head for the last 10 days or so.  This will be more like a &#8220;digest&#8221; blog post with some half-started thoughts on a few different topics.

1. While visiting my family last week in Kentucky, we decided to go out for dinner at the Cracker Barrel.  My parents _love_ the Cracker Barrel and its turned into somewhat of a tradition for us when my wife and I are in town. We were chatting and waiting for our food when my wife nudged me and pointed to the table next to us where all three people were sitting silently, engrossed in their games on two iPhones and an iPad.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ve done my share of gaming while waiting on the train or bus in Seoul, but it made me kind of sad seeing a family out, but not enjoying each other&#8217;s company.  Technology can really do a lot to bring people together&#8230;but this showed me how powerful it can also be at isolation.  I&#8217;m all for using technology in schools, in parks, in libraries, wherever.  But, as a teacher, it is my responsibility to teach learners that technology is a _tool_ and it should **not** completely take place of face to face interaction.  I have to model the ability to put the phone away when I&#8217;m with another person.

Technology can bring two people together from opposite corners of the world.  But, it can also separate two people just as far even when they&#8217;re in the same room.

2. My in-laws got me a new pair of binoculars for my birthday this year, which is great.  I&#8217;ve never really owned a good pair and I&#8217;m excited to be able to start doing some new things.  I&#8217;ve always been into astronomy and I&#8217;m planning on doing some more amateur stargazing with the binoculars.  As I get better, I want to get into some small telescopes and then even hooking those up to my computer to do some nighttime photography.  I inherited a 300mm Nikkor zoom lens a couple of years ago from a job and I took it outside last night to play with it a little bit.  <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/images/moon07072011.jpg" rel="shadowbox">I took a picture of the moon</a> that I&#8217;m really proud of and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m already addicted to this new hobby.

As always, learning something new pointed two things out to me: A) the pride of discovery and creation that I felt last night with that photo is exactly what I want my students to experience throughout the year, and B) when I had no idea how to photograph the moon, I went to YouTube and looked it up.  We all like the chance to check out tutorials online when they&#8217;re learning new things&#8230;the same goes for me.  There is a great blog post from a follower I have on twitter, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mrschwen" target="_blank">@MrSchwen</a> about <a href="http://mrschwen.blogspot.com/2011/07/maybe-educators-prefer-flipped.html" target="_blank">how the flipped class is not only beneficial to students</a>, but that it can benefit teachers as well.  I would write more on this, but he covered it really well&#8230;I suggest you go check it out.

3. I need to be outside more.  I miss Seoul and being in the city, but being home in the country has really helped remind me how much I appreciate open spaces.  Being able to walk around barefoot in the backyard has done wonders for me this summer.  Having the summer off is a blessing for teachers.  If you&#8217;re like me, you don&#8217;t like being idle.  I do have an itch to get back to work, but I do appreciate and enjoy the break.  Take some time today to go outside and get some  grass stains on your knees&#8230;you won&#8217;t regret it.
