Months ago, I turned off Jetpack on my blog. I use WordPress and Jetpack is a package of apps which handled email subscriptions, comment management, social media posting, etc. Unfortunately, it also collects a _ton_ of information about visitors to the site for their own use.

I&#8217;m not in the business of passing your information along to another company. So, I turned off Jetpack. And off it stays.

As a result, I lost some things, one being email subscriptions. I just activated a new plugin which will handle subscribing to posts via email if that suits your fancy. Fill out the form at the bottom of the page with your name and email to opt in. Make sure you confirm your email address in the confirmation email you get!

As a matter of policy, I don&#8217;t collect any information about you without you knowing. 

Email opt in is voluntary. Your email address stays private. Always.

If you would like posts mailed physically, send me a tweet, [@bennettscience](http://www.twitter.com/bennettscience) or leave a comment below and I&#8217;ll get in touch with you. Completely serious offer.
