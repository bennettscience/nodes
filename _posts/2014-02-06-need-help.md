I mentioned [yesterday](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/flip-flops-and-a-gimp-bump-map/) that I&#8217;m leading a conversation at Saturday&#8217;s NovaNOW conference in Grand Rapids. The topic: Flipped Learning pros and cons. I can pull from my experience, but one sample does not a study make (or something like that).

I sent a short survey out on Twitter already, but I&#8217;m posting it here in case anyone who subscribes isn&#8217;t on Twitter. If you&#8217;re a flipped educator, I would _really_ appreciate your contribution. It won&#8217;t take long, 5-7 minutes tops. You can do it right here on the blog or visit <a href="http://bit.ly/myflipstory" target="blank">bit.ly/myflipstory</a> to bookmark it for later or to share it with your friends.



Sharing is caring, folks. Here&#8217;s the link in case you missed it at the top: <a href="http://bit.ly/myflipstory" target="blank">bit.ly/myflipstory</a>
