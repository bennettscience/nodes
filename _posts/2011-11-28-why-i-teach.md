Before Thanksgiving break, I gave my classes a short evaluation. It was totally anonymous and they were askedÂ about things they liked, things they[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-838" title="IMG_0011" src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0011-e1322514604439.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" />](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0011.jpg) disliked, and things they would change. To be totally honest, reading the responses was both easy and difficult. Some were good and gave constructive criticism on how to address issues I knew existed. On the other hand, some made (personal?) attacks on my classes and my style of teaching. I know the flipped class is different than any other class, so I didn&#8217;t expect glowing evaluations from the kids because it _has_ been a hard year for many of them.

Anyways, I&#8217;m not one to commiserate an evaluation, so I addressed issues today in class and apologized for my shortcomings and promised to try to do better for the end of the semester. I found this note from a learner on my desk after school:

> Don&#8217;t blame yourself for our mistakes. You are making tasks as simple as possible. You are a really good teacher and a lot of students take advantage, I know becuz even I do it. I&#8217;m sorry.
  
> \*Take Pride\*

The person that wrote this is _not_ the one I would have picked to offer an encouraging note to their hardest teacher. Notes like this remind me not to take for granted the impact, positive or negative, I have in a child&#8217;s life.

I don&#8217;t find my meaning in affirming notes, but they sure do help me remember not to miss the bigger lessons.
