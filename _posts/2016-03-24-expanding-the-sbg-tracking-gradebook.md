I mentioned [Evan Weingberg&#8217;s](http://evanweinberg.com/2016/02/25/standards-based-grading-streamlining-assessments/) standards-based tracking system [in a short snippet](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/teaching-thoughts/) a couple weeks back. I want to expand on that thought a little bit.

Essentially, he uses a Google Sheet to aggregate quiz performance to make sure standards are _actually_ learned over time. This has been incredibly valuable to me because I felt that students were growing, but had no solid longitudinal data to back that up. It&#8217;s not 100% objective (nor should it be), but it helps inform and confirm (or refute) my gut feeling about a student.

I grade my quiz questions on a 1-4 scale rather than Evan&#8217;s 1-3 using a rubric I made _years_ ago with significant help from [Jenn Binis](http://www.twitter.com/jennbinis).

This is posted in my room and helps me give more specific feedback to my students. The quality in responses _and_ in corrections has jumped dramatically. The rubric is also nice because it can be adapted to just about any question.

I give numeric feedback to students on their quizzes, but most of the time, students toss them in recycling on the way out. I&#8217;d like to have a way for students to take a look at their longitudinal growth over the course of a chapter. The idea is to take Evan&#8217;s original format and create a companion sheet which is specific to each student &#8211; some kind of template mixed with [doctopus](http://cloudlab.newvisions.org/add-ons/doctopus) so I can update a master sheet and each student _also_ can see their personal growth on a connected reporting sheet.

I&#8217;m not 1:1 this year, so implementing it before the end of the semester isn&#8217;t a major priority, but it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to tinker with over the summer to see if I can&#8217;t work out.
