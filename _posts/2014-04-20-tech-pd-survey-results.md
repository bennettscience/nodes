### Survey Analysis

Last week, I distributed a short survey on technology and professional development. I&#8217;ve typed up some brief analysis, looking at major patterns and asking new questions, in a public <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwgeQfi6tpnrYKSz_vvSYuslMqWwlYlSkup12qTli5s/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">Google Doc</a>. Please head over there to read the full summary and leave comments if you have them.

### Graphics

I took some of my data and made it into a short infographic, highlighting some of the quantitative results. It helps paint a picture of who I heard from and what they had to say about technology use and professional development they&#8217;ve done.

As always, comments are welcome on either the post or the full report within the context of the analysis.

Thank you to everyone who took time to complete the survey. I appreciate the help and the insight you helped me to find.
