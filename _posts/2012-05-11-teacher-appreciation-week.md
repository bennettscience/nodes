&#8220;I&#8217;m a teacher and I **deserve** to be recognized. Yes, I&#8217;ll take a PTA lunch. Thank you for the cards and candy. I&#8217;m awesome.&#8221;

Then I remember that I&#8217;m only a teacher because of the people around me. How much more meaningful would this week be if we take time to appreciate what it means **to be** a teacher?

I spent an entire class period this year talking with a student about a bad breakup. What did that mean to her? What does it mean when I stay at school to five or six o&#8217;clock with a club? What does it mean when I go to the school play or musical?

I wouldn&#8217;t get to have those experiences or relationships if I wasn&#8217;t a teacher.

I appreciate students and the hard work of learning. I appreciate my administrators and colleagues.

I love a fist bump in the hallway as a student walks by. I love laughing and crying with students. I love jokes and serious conversations and everything in between.

I&#8217;m blessed to be a teacher.
