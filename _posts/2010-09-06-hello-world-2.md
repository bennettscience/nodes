Mastering chemistry seems like it would be an oxymoron.  Who can master chemistry?  Is chemistry &#8220;master-able?&#8221;

I like to think so.

If we can teach students to think and make informed decisions, then we&#8217;re teaching them to be master learners.  We shouldn&#8217;t be teaching only a textbook&#8230;in fact, the textbook shouldn&#8217;t even be guiding curriculum.  Students today don&#8217;t connect with textbooks.  Students want interactivity and elasticity in their classes.  We need to be teaching students to think critically and decide what is important information and what isn&#8217;t, they can master any content on their own.

I am trying to provide my students with a curriculum and tools to become master learners.  In the process, I have discovered many new tools that have increased my capability to learn material.  Many of the tools are Web 2.0 oriented and some are traditional methods.  By blending &#8220;old-school&#8221; and &#8220;new-school&#8221; we can better serve students in schools today.

This blog is to archive some tools I have found and have been implementing in my chemistry classes.  Please feel free to comment on and share other tools you have found for you class.
