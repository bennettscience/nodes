I was able to travel again this year to Germany to attend the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) conference. Last year, I spoke about teacher approaches to Flipped Learning. I tried to cover all of the content areas to give ideas of how teachers were approaching content and using class time more effectively.

This year, I was able to come and share student responses to flipping. In my last post, I asked for help with a survey, and you all came through! I had over 100 responses (making it a _little_ more legit), with nearly 80% of those coming directly from students. I was able to pull out six major themes to lead a discussion with German educators from all levels. The hour was fantastic, and even included two current university students who were able to speak directly to a group of professors about class time, grading, and the pressures they feel in the classroom. I&#8217;ve got some notes I need to digest from the hour we spent together.

There are three things in the folder linked below:

  * The Google form I used to collect responses.
  * You can read through the spreadsheet or use the &#8220;View summary&#8221; tool in the form itself.
  * The slides from today&#8217;s discussion

The images I used in the slides are attributed in the notes for each.

Finally, I referenced a study completed by the University of Michigan and Michigan State University which questioned whether or not students would use screencasts if there were no external requirement. The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2013/04/04/data-on-whether-and-how-students-watch-screencasts/" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Casting Out Nines blog post</a> analyzes the data and includes a link the the [published PDF](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb01126.x/abstract). I wanted to call it out here because it has deep implications for how we approach creating and sharing digital content.
