I&#8217;ve been struggling to find time to write recently. This has been a good and a bad thing. For one, I&#8217;m busy with learners during the day and I&#8217;m spending more time planning new activities and recording new and updated podcasts. I&#8217;m also doing multiple presentations this month and next, so I&#8217;ve been working on planning for those as well.

But, on the other hand, my head is about as full as it can get. I haven&#8217;t had much time to process any one thought from the past week, so I figured I would do a &#8220;systems purge&#8221; or sorts to start some thoughts and see where they go this week.

1. I&#8217;ve felt convicted about grading lately, and it usually comes around when I open my grade book to put more marks in. I really need to take some time to sit down and think through my philosophy of grading, because I think I am most unhappy about that right now. I don&#8217;t think the grades are representative of learner progress, and that is a major problem. I&#8217;m reading a lot of Frank Noschese&#8217;s writing on [standards based grading](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/category/standards-based-grading-2/) as well as [Audrey McLaren](http://www.twitter.com/a_mcsquared)&#8216;s writing on using Google Docs as [checklists and tracking](http://audrey-mcsquared.blogspot.com/2011/09/googledocs-will-you-marry-me.html) of learner progress. I want to use both _bad_, but I can&#8217;t find the time to do my own learning.</p> 

2. The fall conference season is upon us and I have one of the busiest schedules I&#8217;ve ever had. I&#8217;m travelling to the Indiana Computer Educators Conference in Indianapolis next week to do a Flipped Classroom workshop with [Troy Cockrum](http://www.twitter.com/tcockrum) and [Brett Clark](http://www.twitter.com/mr_brett_clark). This will be my first &#8220;panel&#8221; presentation and I&#8217;m looking forward to the new dynamic.
  
Then, on October 26th, I&#8217;m doing an in-service session for new teachers in the district on some of the Flipped Classroom basics each of us can use to move toward a more engaging class.
  
Thirdly, I&#8217;m going to EdCamp: Grand Rapids, and to be totally honest, I&#8217;m more excited about that one than any of the other. I&#8217;ll get to work with [Dan Spencer](http://www.twitter.com/runfardvs) again and I&#8217;m excited because he&#8217;s always got good things to share.
  
Oh, then there&#8217;s the ISTE proposal I&#8217;m still mulling over. Can&#8217;t forget about that.

3. I wish I had more handheld devices in my room. Learners interact better with touch-interface now rather than computer interfaces. Still trying to figure out how to solve that problem.

4. I&#8217;ve started using [Andy Schwen&#8217;s](http://www.twitter.com/mrschwen) Google Documents [assessment templates](http://mrschwen.blogspot.com/p/assessment-template.html) to collect data and I&#8217;m amazed at some of the numbers coming through. If you don&#8217;t click on any other links today, click this one&#8230;it will blow your mind.

I think that&#8217;s it. I have another post <del datetime="2011-10-03T22:21:14+00:00">fermenting</del> ripening in my notebook and hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to put that up this week as well.

Thanks for mishmashing with me today.
