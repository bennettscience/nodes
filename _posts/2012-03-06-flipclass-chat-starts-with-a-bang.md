Monday, March 5 was the inaugural #flipclass chat event. We promoted the chat on Twitter, Google+, and various blogs to push a great first session. After crunching some data collected in the archive, it was bigger than I had anticipated. In the hour-long chat, there were:

  * 95 individual tweeters
  * 888 total tweets, 869 of them being unique
  * 77 links shared
  * hundreds of [connections made](http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/?key=0ArUphN8boIo2dFNTU3dENVFwT0RYZnFqbXp5dGw2dGc&sheet=oaw)

The first topic chosen for the chat was &#8220;What are some problems you&#8217;ve faced since flipping your class?&#8221; I knew there were some common areas that would be discussed, but the collaboration last night went above and beyond my expectations.

Rather than lamenting our problems, proactive and encouraging tweets began to flood my TweetDeck column.

Some of the notable tweets from the chat:

    The most important part of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/flipclass?src=hash">#flipclass</a> is the time you devote to planning meaningful and engaging activities that expand upon video topics.

Other favorites included discussion about the role of [red Solo cups](https://twitter.com/#!/mistermcintosh/statuses/176848130443194370) and [alien abductions](https://twitter.com/#!/josepopoff/statuses/176847819410374656) in a flipped classroom.

In the end, the most encouraging thing was to be able to witness an amazing group of educators find new contacts or encouragement, all through the power of social media. People chatting from across continents and in different countries were able to find common ground to push their own classes to new levels.

The #flipclass chat will continue to be on Monday evenings at 8 PM EST. <del>Polls and archives are all linked from the <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/flipclass-chat">Flipclass Chat</a> page on this blog.</del> I want to encourage you to connect with some of the people participating in the chats and we all look forward to having you join us next time!
