Our district is distributing 13,000 iPads in the next 24 months. We have ~1,300 staff who need to be trained on instructional methods with technology in addition to functional training on a new platform, using GSuite effectively and building a course in Canvas.

Training has been touchpoint number one for our team. We&#8217;re not in a culture where it&#8217;s normal &#8211; or expected &#8211; for you to go research and try something before requesting in-person help. Before this year, there _was_ no in-person help. When I started this role in July, we were starting from ground zero. To handle how-to requests, we started a YouTube channel and a simple ticketing system. On Mondays, we host some simple how-to training workshops to get functional basics down. Otherwise, all of our training has focused on instructional changes in the classroom.

The hardest thing about building a culture of exploration and self-driven growth is the temptation to just fall back on what would alleviate people&#8217;s stress, but not actually solve the problem. Designing an effective workshop is much more than answering the questions asked. We&#8217;re constantly evaluating ways in which we ask teachers to engage with the principles of instruction we&#8217;re modeling without falling into the trap of giving lesson templates to be repeated throughout the district.

## Move training beyond content

It&#8217;s difficult to model a lesson completely void of content. In fact, I think it would be bad practice to do so because ignoring content for the sake of context is a disservice to students. Content is important. But, in this case, it needs to be the backdrop. The lesson we&#8217;re modeling may be based on science, but we want to pull out the instructional practices that can be applied anywhere, not just in the immediate context. We use &#8220;metacognitive moments&#8221; embedded at strategic points in the task which ask teachers to identify what would work in their situation.

## Prompts that force teachers to abstract _to_ the lesson, not go _through_ a lesson

Stemming from moving beyond content, my content expertise is in high school science. We focus on helping teachers apply the methods we&#8217;re modeling to their classroom using their expertise. I cannot tell an elementary english teacher to model the lesson in exactly the way I did. But, I can ask probing questions and push that teacher to reflect on what the principles of the lesson are, where they&#8217;re already utilizing those ideas, and where they could implement more.

## Avoid key phrases like &#8220;compare and contrast&#8221;

Trigger phrases can immediately drop the level of discussion. _Compare and contrast_ is especially egregious because people &#8211; teachers and students &#8211; fall back to a two-circle Venn diagram to complete the _task_ without _analyzing the problem_. Action verbs are important&#8230;we _do_ want people to compare and contrast, but we avoid the trigger attached to the status quo.

## Encourage big thinking

When you&#8217;ve never had training on changing practice, you don&#8217;t know how to think big. Or, you don&#8217;t feel empowered to take the risks. Our workshops are often the first time a teacher has been encouraged to express agency and implement the big ideas. We regularly get emails weeks after a workshop where a teacher has taken something they&#8217;d learned and implemented it successfully. Excitement is palpable and it pushes them to continue to try new things.

## Repurpose existing tools for new uses

&#8220;Hacking&#8221; education is all the rage right now, but the term comes with baggage. I don&#8217;t want teachers to feel like they need to be &#8220;hip&#8221; or a &#8220;rockstar&#8221; to change practice. We ask them to repurpose something &#8211; a tool they use regularly &#8211; to accomplish a new task. danah boyd talks about using Wikipedia article discussions to teach lessons about history, culture, and context in her book, [_It&#8217;s Complicated_](https://www.danah.org/books/ItsComplicated.pdf) (jump to page 190 for the example). The idea is simple in merit but difficult to implement, especially if you&#8217;re not used to thinking beyond the immediate function.
