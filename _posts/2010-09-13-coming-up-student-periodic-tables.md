Part of the mastery system is assessing students through their own, unique work.  For this next unit (beginning today) students have an opportunity to show me what they know through their own digital periodic tables based on&#8230;cereal.

While this isn&#8217;t _true_ student-driven assessment, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction for my class.  I&#8217;m hoping to be able to do something like this for every unit&#8230;I&#8217;m just not there yet.  For this project, they have to do a lab in which they produce a [periodic table based on different cereals](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CEINMlx7xphIXfSf_SCpjkvWtZ3O4AkyGQQyd5uDZns).  They have the option to turn in a supplementary video to be used as their chapter assessment.  I&#8217;m _really_ hoping I can get some of the more creative students to jump at this opportunity.  We&#8217;ll see in a week or two what I get.
