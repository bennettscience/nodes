I have to be honest&#8230;I almost posted this yesterday, about an hour after I posted about the [fishbowl discussion](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/the-fishbowl-not-your-normal-discussion/ "The Fishbowl – Not Your Normal Discussion").  But, I decided to bite my tongue and think through everything that was flying through my head.

Not many things increase my blood pressure, but when I read [this article](http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2011/04/19/ri_lawmaker_wants_to_mute_cellphones_during_school/) from the Boston Globe website, I probably should have taken an aspirin to lower it a little bit (it isn&#8217;t long&#8230;I suggest you take a look at it).

Essentially, the Rhode Island legislature is reviewing a bill that would &#8220;prohibit students from using cellphones during the school day.&#8221;

Seriously?

We need to **stop** making cellphones the scapegoat and **start** engaging students when they&#8217;re in the classroom!

The problem isn&#8217;t the phone, which is what the legislators and teachers are focusing on.  The problem is that teachers aren&#8217;t challenging students with relevant, meaningful instruction and students are bored with school.

The article concludes with the following:

> <div>
>   <p>
>     &#8220;They can live without distractions for a few hours every day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We grew up without them.&#8221;
>   </p>
> </div>

If this is the prevailing attitude, we&#8217;re _never_ going to reach a reform in education.  As teachers, it is our job to convince parents, administrators, colleagues, and even the government that we don&#8217;t need more oversight&#8230;we need more **freedom** of technology use.  Students today are growing up in the 21st century&#8230;and like it or not, that includes cell phones, smart phones, ipods/pads, and a thousand other tools.  Instead of fearing the change, we should push the change and teach these kids how to effectively use the power of information availability.

Don&#8217;t jam 21st century learners into a 20th century learning model because that&#8217;s what &#8220;we&#8221; had to do.  Let&#8217;s continue to dialogue and set the example so we can push education forward, and not backward.
