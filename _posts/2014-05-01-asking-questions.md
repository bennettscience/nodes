Short post tonight. For the final assignment this semester, we were asked to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/opinion/friedman-its-pq-and-cq-as-much-as-iq.html?_r=0" target="blank">Thomas Friedman&#8217;s OpEd</a> on _Passion Quotient_ and _Curiosity Quotient_ as the big need moving forward in the world (the previous need being IQ &#8211; intelligence quotient).

I have to admit, this particular assignment really stumped me. I wasn&#8217;t sure about what I thought or how to best communicate those ideas. In the end, I thought about a world without passion or curiosity, and when I landed myself in that spot. Rather than telling here, on the blog, I used my absolute favorite iPad app: <a href="http://www.storehouse.co" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Storehouse</a>. The preview below will jump you to the story.
