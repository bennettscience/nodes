I was able to squeak out another [audio assignment](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/beat-craigs-list/) today for [the zone](http://www.ds106.us). While it isn&#8217;t Twilight Zone based, sometimes reading [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org) can feel like [its own alternate universe](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/all/). 

I chose to [beat Craigslist](http://assignments.ds106.us/types/audioassignments/) because&#8230;well, because finding a ridiculous post was pretty fun. I made sure to stick local, so I humbly submit the following performance using material provided by my community:

[soundcloud url=&#8221;http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/95428636&#8243; params=&#8221;&#8221; width=&#8221; 100%&#8221; height=&#8221;166&#8243; iframe=&#8221;true&#8221; /]

This was pretty simple, as I stuck to GarageBand loops and samples. I recorded my voice right into the program and then added the radio voice effect to brighten the sound a little bit. It&#8217;s short, but it was fun.

If you don&#8217;t believe this post is real&#8230;I beg to differ.
