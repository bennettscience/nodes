You may have missed [this story](http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/10/us/california-school-shooting/index.html) out of California last week.

A student brought a shotgun to school with the intent of killing some other students who had bullied him. He shot one student, and two other students and a teacher were injured. What the headlines missed is that the teacher and a colleague managed to talk the student into giving up his weapon.

No other shots were fired.

The shooting is a tragedy, but the real story here is that, <a href-"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/us/nra-calls-for-armed-guards-at-schools.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">contrary to what the NRA says</a>, there are other ways to stop people with guns.

These teachers are heroes because they risked their lives to protect the victims but also to protect the life of the shooter. Relationships are the way to protect our students, not more guns.
