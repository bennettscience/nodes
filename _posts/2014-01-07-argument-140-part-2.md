I updated the original post, but I thought it would be worth having a brand new item for reference. As I said earlier, the [@StopSBG](http://www.twitter.com/StopSBG) account has been unsuspended, and they are now tweeting again. I haven&#8217;t been paying much attention to the ongoing conversation so I can do other things, like eat and sleep. But, what I have done, is used [Martin Hawksey&#8217;s](http://www.twitter.com/mhawksey) _amazing_ [Google Docs-driven Twitter archive script](http://mashe.hawksey.info/2013/02/twitter-archive-tagsv5/) to automatically archive the tweets.

**[View the archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArUphN8boIo2dDhKZ2JIeVZreWs3VXRXdTdUa2JuSmc&usp=sharing)**

I can only look back seven days at a time, so unfortunately, the initial conversation is lost, unless you use another service, like topsy.com to search for yourself. But, this spreadsheet is probably the most complete archive of the entire 5,000+ exchange happening. The archive will update every couple of hours and add a new tab at the bottom of the page for convenience. Take a look at the short video below on how to manage the massive amount of data on the sheet.
