I don&#8217;t know what day of class this is, but here&#8217;s what we did today.

* * *

We took a test a week ago that did not go well, to say the least. [I already wrote about that process](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/cultures/). We took this week to slowly go back over ideas and rehash them&#8230;not from scratch, but pretty thoroughly. I&#8217;ve been trying to be more explicit in the methods of interaction &#8211; reading, writing, kinesthetic (lab), drawing, etc. Today was the final day of Newton&#8217;s Laws (_#thesecondone_) and I decided to have them create posters and/or short comics on one of the laws.

These are some of my favorite student pieces:

Are they perfect representations? No. And there are others that show inconsistency. **But**, they were _talking about the ideas_ and _creating their own models based on understanding._ Drawing (sometimes silly) pictures helps to internalize the idea and it opens doors for discussion. It allowed me to enter a conversation about physics at _their_ level and do some intense teaching one on one, which was the goal.

I also challenged myself to creating some stories. I&#8217;m a major fan of [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com), you&#8217;ll notice the resemblance because that&#8217;s my level of artistic ability:

It was a fun, light day with lots of growth. Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll quiz one more time before moving on to work and energy next week.
