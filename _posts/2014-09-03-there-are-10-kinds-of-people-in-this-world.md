Those who can read binary and those who can&#8217;t.

Te first activity we ran through for my Computational Thinking course was learning how to translate simple text into binary. Working at a software company, I feel like I&#8217;ve got a good handle on bits and bytes, pixels and codecs. I know that binary is the base of each of those, but I didn&#8217;t know how they stacked up with one another as the dataset. As I worked through encoding my name, seeing perfect squares helped me get the hang of the pattern pretty quickly. I also understand now why a kilobyte is 1024 bytes and not 1000. I had fun trying to do each letter without using a cheat sheet.
