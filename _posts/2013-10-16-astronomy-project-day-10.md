I made some quick additions this afternoon to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TSCBennett/astro) for this project, which I&#8217;ve renamed to PySky. I had to do some research on the [Pyephem license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) before I packaged it with my code. It turns out it&#8217;s available to distribute freely with other software as long as I provide my source, so now, it&#8217;s packaged with my simple python script.

**Update 9:08 PM 10/16/13**
  
Looks like I wrote the post too soon. I was able to spend some time tonight working on the script after my wife went to bed and I was able to get _both_ of my original problems solved. [The updated script is posted on GitHub](https://github.com/TSCBennett/PySky/blob/master/astro.py).

I was able to find a nifty little [piece of code](http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/code/260268/restart-your-python-program) to help me manage responses to prompts so my code is a little cleaner. I don&#8217;t have to have as many conditionals (if, elif, else) in my functions anymore, which makes everything look a little bit nicer.

<del>As far as my coding, I&#8217;m working on a couple things:</p> 


  <ol>
    <li>
      <del>Users will be able to set their location, rather than having it hardcoded to South Bend (which isn&#8217;t useful at all).</del>
    </li>
    <li>
      <del>The program needs to be able to save the location data for all lookups. I think a global variable is a good way to do this, but I need to learn more.</del>
    </li>
  </ol>

    Things have been crazy lately, so I haven&#8217;t touched this in a while. I&#8217;m still also working on getting the hardware I need to get my Raspberry Pi up and running. The only video-out it has is an HDMI port. I don&#8217;t have a monitor that can take HDMI, and I&#8217;m having a hard time tracking an HDMI-to-VGA adapter down. I might need to turn to Amazon for this one.

  <p>
    <b>BUT</b>, I <i>did</i> get another crucial piece of hardware for this little jaunt that I&#8217;m <i>very</i> excited about.

    Of course, it happened to come on the cloudiest day of the month so far. I&#8217;ll post more pictures of the scope in a later post.
