The community is suffering. Students are frustrated and they&#8217;re looking to me to solve the problem. I&#8217;m faced with deciding whether or not my commitment to an individual students takes precedence over my commitment to the class as a whole.

I mentioned earlier today in a tweet that [Audrey Watters](http://www.twitter.com/audreywatters) had a post back in January about applying the [Hippocratic Oath](http://hackeducation.com/2015/01/21/hippocratic-oath) (albeit, for education technology, but the application is the same) and it&#8217;s really stuck with me. I&#8217;d never read the oath, but now I have one printed and hanging next to my desk. I&#8217;ve started to re-purpose some of the lines in <a href="http://guides.library.jhu.edu/c.php?g=202502&p=1335759" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">the 1964 rewrite of the Oath</a> to apply a little more to my day to day work.

> I will apply, for the benefit of students, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and educational nihilism.

I think the first time I had a student leave my room was in my third year teaching. My temper doesn&#8217;t get pushed too much and I can usually let the little things roll on by. Small redirection and nuance have been powerful tools for me, and they&#8217;d worked relatively well. This year, though, it&#8217;s a whole different story. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve given up hope that these students can learn or improve, but my toolbox is feeling more and more empty as I try more and more techniques to rein in the behaviors.

> I will not be ashamed to say &#8220;I know not,&#8221; nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed.

I really resist having students leave my room. Perhaps it&#8217;s hubris, perhaps it&#8217;s stubbornness. I refuse to fall into a habit of removing problems rather than resolving. However, at what point do we move on from individual situations and focus on the whole? Am I shirking responsibility as a teacher by relegating individual students to situations where learning is impossible? On the other hand, by keeping students in the room, am I relegating the whole class to the same fate?

> I will remember that there is art to teaching as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding outweigh the expectation of compliance or any grade awarded.

Finding nuance in a situation where patience feels like the enemy is difficult. The more time I take to try and weave a better plan together for individuals feels like time lost for the other 22 people in the room. I&#8217;m falling back on old habits and a bad attitude about students. My empathy is running out and I&#8217;m entering a realm where I&#8217;d rather have compliance than a real rich atmosphere for learning.

> If it is given me to arouse curiosity, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to stifle the desire to learn; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty.

I realize that it&#8217;s the teacher&#8217;s burden to always remember the ones we lost &#8211; those we couldn&#8217;t connect with or engage. In the end, I&#8217;d love to have my cake and eat it, too. I think I can still do that &#8211; there are bright spots, and we celebrate those days. But, I&#8217;m responsible for the learning environment as a whole.
