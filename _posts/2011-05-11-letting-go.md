As we head into the end of the school year, I&#8217;ve done a lot of reflecting on the content I was able to finish this year.  I am fortunate in that I don&#8217;t have standardized testing to worry about and that my principal is very &#8220;hands-off&#8221; and lets me try new things with my class.

We&#8217;re down to 3 weeks before exams and I decided that I&#8217;ve taught enough this year.  I&#8217;m going to be letting my students direct their own learning on a topic of their choice.  They still have to apply it to chemistry, but apart from that, it is totally up to them.

I got this idea from <a href="http://www.jabizraisdana.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Jabiz Raisdana</a> (twitter @intrepidteacher) as he posted links to student surveys and questionnaires during _their_ chosen unit of study.  He was kind enough to send me links to <a href="http://www.jabizraisdana.com/blog/unit-of-inquiry-part-i/" target="_blank" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">his own unit plan</a> for turning the learning over to the students.

I do have to admit, I am terrified of this backfiring totally&#8230;like riding a bike without using the handlebars.  But, I have faith in my students and that they&#8217;ve learned enough about their own learning styles to really grab on to this project.  You can follow the updates from my class website if you&#8217;re interested in seeing my framework.  I&#8217;m sure it will also inspire multiple blog posts over the next couple of weeks as I figure out if this was a good idea or not.
