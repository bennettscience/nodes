As the year winds down, I find myself thinking frequently about all the change I&#8217;ve gone through. This post doesn&#8217;t have a particular theme or any real deep insights&#8230;more of a year-in-review.

&#8212; This time last year, I was in Thailand riding an elephant. It was probably one of the best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had and I think about it frequently. If anyone ever asks you to go to Thailand, stop what you are doing, and get on the airplane. You won&#8217;t regret it. 

&#8212; I feel very blessed to have a home in the United States, but some days (many days) I do wish I lived a simpler life. Having the opportunity to travel within Asia really gave me perspective on how much I take for granted. I&#8217;m much more aware of the luxuries I have access to and I try and share that with my students, but it is very hard to communicate that feeling to others.

&#8212; Moving back to the US from abroad had more culture shock involved than moving abroad from the US.

&#8212; The power of connections through social media cannot be ignored. I searched for work for six months before connecting with [Brett Clark](http://www.twitter.com/Mr_Brett_Clark) in Evansville, IN. He contacted me to Skype into a learning session on the Flipped Classroom and it ended up being an interview for my current position. For that, I am extremely thankful.

&#8212; American public schools are in need of innovators and our students need people that care about more than standardized test scores. Learning has been killed by testing and I refuse to let the status quo proliferate in my classroom.

&#8212; Sometimes the best thing we can do for our schools is be present. We don&#8217;t always need to be vocal about making changes. Change happens naturally from practice, not from always being &#8220;that guy.&#8221; Cause more ripples in the pond&#8230;don&#8217;t drop bombs all the time.

&#8212; I need to celebrate failure as much as (more than?) successes. That is including student failure alongside my own. I have been extremely aware of learning through mistakes lately.

&#8212; Learning is important to me, but I need to take times to step back and let my brain rest.

&#8212; When I let my brain rest, it usually means my body is working hard. I helped build a garage last weekend and it was great to be outside working with my hands, even though I know nothing about building anything more substantial than a pillow fort.

&#8212; My wife and I did homemade Christmas gifts this year and I am thinking about making that the norm rather than a one-time deal. We still bought small gifts for one another, but the bulk of our gift-giving was DIY. I feel much more excited about giving this year than I have in the past.

&#8212; Driving between our families&#8217; homes is tiring, but it is so nice to be able to actually drive between homes during the break.

&#8212; I have a lot of work coming up once break is over, but that is a full week away. Right now, I am home, with my family, and that is where I need to be.

Take time this year to be present. Don&#8217;t just exist in the room, but invest in your parents, your spouse, your kids, or whoever you&#8217;re with. Be intentional about looking people in the eye and connecting this year. Focus on the same with your students when we go back to school. But above all: continue to learn, continue to grow.
