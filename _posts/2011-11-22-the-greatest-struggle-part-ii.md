I&#8217;m trying to capture the small moments each day with short posts. I feel like I glaze over these moments too quickly and I lose out on one of the joys of teaching.

Today, I had a chance to work with a couple of girls _really_ struggling with a concept. I rephrased, remediated, and gave new examples. The frustration was tangible and you could tell they were thinking harder than they&#8217;d been asked to in a while.

Then, it broke. The light bulbs went on and the got it. And I mean they _got_ it.

Meaning gets lost in quick answers. I could have easily just told them what to do step-by-step, but at what cost? It is painful to watch and our instincts as teachers tell us to swoop in and save the day. Let the kids struggle sometimes. It&#8217;s worth the pain.
