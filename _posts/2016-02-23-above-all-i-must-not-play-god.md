The [Hippocratic Oath](http://guides.library.jhu.edu/c.php?g=202502&p=1335759) really parallels education. More on that [somewhere else](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/the-solemn-duty-of-educating/).

I cannot play at God in my classroom. I am not a dictator. My role is to provide an environment and situation in which students can learn. I work hard to do that. I take that responsibility very seriously.

[Choices](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/choices) are made by students to either trust me in the process laid out or to try their own road. Some can definitely handle their own road and I&#8217;m proud and thankful for that. Others need to be carried a great distance before they&#8217;re ready to walk on their own.

But I cannot make it happen. It isn&#8217;t my responsibility to make the choice for students. It never will be.

I can&#8217;t hold myself accountable for decisions that aren&#8217;t mine.

  I&#8217;m not a doctor, but I think this idea stands out the most.
