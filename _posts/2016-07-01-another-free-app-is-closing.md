News came down this week that \[Zaption\](http://www.zaption.com), a popular web app that layers quiz question and other interactive features on top of videos, is closing it&#8217;s doors on September 30th.

Unlike some of the \[other\](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/2016/06/the-education-freeconomy-gobbles-up-another/) \[recent\](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/2015/03/another-casualty-of-the-free-only-economy/) closures, \[Zaption is being purchased by a finance firm\](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-30-zap-zaption-sold-to-workday) (Workday) located in San Francisco. The terms of the sale aren&#8217;t public, but my guess is that Workday wants to expand it&#8217;s learning service to include interactive features for their client base. It adds value to something they&#8217;ve already built out and saves the hassle of licensing fees.

Here&#8217;s the kicker: Zaption, as far as I can tell, has no information in their \[Terms of Service\](https://www.zaption.com/terms) or \[Privacy Policy\](https://www.zaption.com/privacy) about what happens to user data. Nothing came up when I searched the page for \*\*sale, sold, acquire, acquired, bankrupt, bankruptcy purchase, purchased, asset, assets, or close.\*\*

User data is valuable in most cases. The immediate concern is that user data will be transferred in this sale with no prior disclosure. I&#8217;ve reached out to Zaption via Twitter asking for clarification on the plan for that data. Given the buyer and Zaptions offering, I&#8217;m hoping data transfer isn&#8217;t in the deal and that the purchase is for the codebase. 

There are two important things to remember:

1. &#8220;Free&#8221; always has a cost associated with it.
  
2. Read the Privacy Policy and Terms for the apps you use. 

What happens to data in these situations is important. If you&#8217;re looking for a good place to start, \[Bill Fitzgerald\](http://www.twitter.com/funnymonkey) worked on a project with Common Sense Media to create a \[Privacy Policy Browser\](http://privacy.graphite.org/) covering the conditions for some popular educational websites and apps. Check it out and see what you&#8217;ve agreed to. Being informed is important.
