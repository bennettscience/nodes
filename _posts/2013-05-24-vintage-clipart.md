Rounding out my assignments for the week, I&#8217;ve got a brand-spankin-new piece of [vintage clip art](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/graphic-gift/) for you to use in your next PowerPoint (because PPT is so much fun).

The [original image](http://file.vintageadbrowser.com/l-8vzvxffso6symr.jpg) came from a SONY ad for a projection TV from the 1980&#8217;s. I found this on [VintageAdBrowser.com](http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/), which has ads from the early 1900&#8217;s, categorized by ad type. It&#8217;s pretty awesome.

You can grab the [HIGH RES PNG](http://ohheybrian.com/images/clipartTV.png) if you want to use it for some ds106 fun:

<div id="attachment_2150" style="max-width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/clipartTINA.png"><img src="http://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/clipartTINA.png" alt="I am Talky Tina..." width="660" height="441" class="size-full wp-image-2150" srcset="https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/clipartTINA.png 660w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/clipartTINA-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.ohheybrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/clipartTINA-100x66.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    AHHH SHE REALLY IS ALWAYS WATCHING
  </p>
</div>

&#8230;or the [smaller file](http://ohheybrian.com/images/clipart-small.png) for something easier to use.

This one was mostly about selecting out the original baseball image, and then cleaning up around the hands still in the frame. If you want to change the resolution, here&#8217;s the .xcf for your riffing pleasure.
