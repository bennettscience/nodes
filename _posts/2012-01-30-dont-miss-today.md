Teachers are planners, in case you didn&#8217;t know. We like to plan units weeks ahead of time, plan for technology or behavior issues, and even plan for what our ideal classroom will look like in the future.

Sometimes, we plan so much, that we tend to _only_ see the ideal, which can lead to discouragement and disenfranchisement in teaching. 

Personally, I think about re-purposing my classroom. I don&#8217;t like tables and chairs. I like couches. I like standing desks. I like varied floor space. Every learner is different, so to teach to different needs, we should have different spaces for learning.

Sometimes I get caught up in the future of teaching and I miss the needs of learners _now_. Always be reflective and always be working to form a better system. But, be careful not to dream at the expense of your students today.
