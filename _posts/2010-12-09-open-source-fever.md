I&#8217;ve developed a fever over the past week.  I found a program called [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/), an open-source project aimed at making other open-source projects available to people.

Long story short, I had to install a couple of other programs (including MacPorts, from which all other installations were completed), but I didn&#8217;t end up using Wine.  I did, however, begin to play with MacPorts and some of the open-source freeware available.  I&#8217;ve caught the bug.

I&#8217;ve always had an interest in astronomy, but living in Seoul (population 18 million) makes it a little difficult to see much more than Jupiter on an extremely clear night.  In my toying with MacPorts, I found an open-source program called [Nightshade](http://nightshadesoftware.org/), which is by far one of the best astronomy simulators I have ever seen.  I am now thinking about proposing a new astronomy class to be offered at my school because of the capabilities.

Like I said, I&#8217;ve caught the fever.
