I posted earlier that I&#8217;d been having a hard time working with the assigned episodes this week. When I got home, I decided to watch a different episode and see what would happen. I turned on [Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_the_Real_Martian_Please_Stand_Up%3F) from season two of The Twilight Zone. I hadn&#8217;t ever seen this one, and the episodes with UFO&#8217;s and aliens involved always intrigued me.

(As a kid, I borrowed a TON of UFO books from the library, and then I started to get freaked out, so I stopped.)

I loved the disparity between the characters in this episode, and I thought I had it all figured out. Well, it turned out that I forgot I was in the Zone, and Serling pulled a fast one on me. Again.

I decided to do another [minimalist book cover](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/minimalist-book-covers/) for this episode, mostly because the image popped into my head immediately. Plus, I figured the one I did on [_A Clockwork Orange_](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/a-clockwork-orange-minimalist-cover-design/) was done before the class started, so _technically_, I&#8217;m not redoing a project I&#8217;ve already completed.

I used a couple tricks taught to me today by Shannon Tate after commenting on her _beautiful_ [House of Leaves](http://shannotate.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/minimalist-book-cover-house-of-leaves/) book cover. They really helped me achieve more texture in the image overlay and the text, which made me happy.

I feel like I&#8217;m back on the horse and I&#8217;m looking forward to (maybe) getting another project done this weekend, and definitely starting fresh next week.
