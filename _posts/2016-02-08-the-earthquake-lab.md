Waves are tricky to teach. Students feel like they already have a ton of experience with them (you&#8217;ve been to the beach somewhere, I&#8217;m sure.) and that there isn&#8217;t a whole lot more to learn. So, I try to make it hands on and connect with other areas of interest.

For instance, I brought my guitar into school. Music is waves working well together. So, I fiddled around during class while they were working and had them make connections between the guitar and the theory of waves. A few days later, I moved into a NOVA episode about the 2011 Japan earthquake and resulting tsunami&#8230;more waves. Students were able to connect the abstract &#8211; longitudinal and transverse waves &#8211; with the concrete &#8211; P and S seismic waves. At this point I introduced the earthquake lab.

### The Setup

Students broke into teams of four and assigned roles &#8211; Project Manager, Treasurer, Research Director, Architect &#8211; based on their interests. Their task was to build a building at least 40cm tall out of spaghetti, marshmallows, and tape which would stand up to an earthquake. [I modified this doc (Word download)](http%3A%2F%2Fmsjanaulis.weebly.com%2Fuploads%2F2%2F4%2F3%2F2%2F2432202%2Fspaghetti_earthquake_lab.doc&) and gave one sheet per group.

### The Challenge

When I assigned this task, I said the structure had to be _at least_ 40cm tall, but I didn&#8217;t tell them that it should be _as tall as possible_. Some groups naturally went for it (one group hit 98cm!) while others played it safe. Next time, the height challenge will be added.

Also, if you look at the document, I dropped the line of credit to $4000, thinking it would make them think through their designs. I also limited their trips to the store (me) to two visits to _really_ make sure they designed. Nearly every group was very intentional, but I still wish I had added the &#8220;economy&#8221; challenge to the height: tallest building you can make (at least 40cm) while staying cheap. Things to remember for next year&#8230;

### The Shaker

The final hurdle was designing an earthquake machine that would shake every building fairly. I also wanted them to see the difference between P and S waves, so it had to shake on two axes. I tried to work through a couple of ideas which would have required cranks, drills, drawer sliders, and lots of engineering and instead landed on something sweet and simple: a tone generator on our LabQuest sets and a hacked apart speaker.

I used some 10-gauge house wire and industrial strength hot glue to add some hooks to the speaker baffle. A small power source let me control the volume of the tone being generated. I drilled holes through a small whiteboard to mount on top of a speaker (P waves) and beside a speaker (S waves). We ran the P waves at around 25Hz and the S between 10-12Hz. The goal was to show students how properly-built buildings resonate _with_ the shake, not fight against it.

It gave a pretty good shake&#8230;my speakers this year were a little small, but it worked well to show resonance. I think if we went for height next year, we&#8217;d get a few more building failures, which are _just_ as important as building successes.
