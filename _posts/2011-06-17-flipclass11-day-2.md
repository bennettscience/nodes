As we headed into day 2 of the flipped class conference, I was really excited about some of the discussions that are coming up with educators from all over the place.  Some of the big takeaways from today:

<a href="http://www.livescribe.com" target="_blank">LiveScribe</a> &#8211; If you can write with a pen, you can do a screencast.  This is a great tool if you&#8217;re not into using a tablet.  You can still have the feel of paper and pen without having to mess with learning how to use a tablet.

  * Pros &#8211; Easy to use, low learning curve, cheap ($50 for 2GB pen), all videos are taken care of LiveScribe (hosting, etc), very portable.
  * Cons &#8211; No editing power (what you do is what you get), no images or video can be included, audio and pen writing only.

&#8212;

I am not a Moodle user, but I&#8217;ve wanted to be and I am planning on working on using it on my own next year (unless my district has it already).  I&#8217;ve already tried to look at adding test questions with a lot of variation, but I couldn&#8217;t figure the interface out.  Then, I met <a href="http://mistermcintoshsays.org" target="_blank">Phil McIntosh</a>.  He teaches MS pre-algebra and algebra and is the Moodle WHIZ.  You can connect with him on twitter by following <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MisterMcIntosh" target="_blank">@MisterMcIntosh</a>.

Just to give you an idea, he has test banks that have almost 9,000 combined questions.  He has worked very, very hard over the last year to develop well-balanced, reliable, test questions that focus on best practices.  His seminar was incredibly precise and organized and you definitely need to get in touch with him if you&#8217;re having trouble with Moodle or if you want help setting up a thorough, well-organized test bank.

&#8212;

Again, today was a great time of collaboration with other educators and some great ideas being shared.  Its very exciting for me as I continue to meet other teachers that are feeling challenged and excited about flipping their class.  Tomorrow is the last day and I&#8217;m hoping we can make some new connections that will continue to push teachers to try and improve their methodology.
