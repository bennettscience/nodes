[Ken Bauer](http://www.twitter.com/ken_bauer) has more energy than I know what to do with. I met him two or three years ago (something like that) and ever since, he&#8217;s taught courses, advanced in his university position, joined the FLN board, and really just been a great friend.

Ken is running an open course (a cMOOC if you want to get technical about things) on Flipped Learning over the next eight weeks just because. He organized everything, set up the website and syndication, promoted, and is now managing 40+ people going through the course. I helped out last year by hopping into a hangout or two with some folks to talk about the Pillars. But, I wasn&#8217;t in the classroom &#8211; I was an invited guest.

This year, I&#8217;m back _in_ the course because I&#8217;m back _in_ the classroom, trying to work out a lot of the same problems I thought I already had answers to. Kudos if you can follow that deeply meta line of thought.

I&#8217;m hoping to reevaluate what I think about flipping. [Paul Andersen](http://www.twitter.com/paulandersen) talked about his love/hate journey with flipping last year at the annual conference. We continued the discussion on a boat. I think I&#8217;m paralleling his journey now&#8230;I like the idea, I&#8217;m frustrated with the implementation and bottle necking (some of which is definitely my fault), but I think it&#8217;s still the right thing to do.

I want to find balance. I want to rework my understanding of what I _do_ and why I do it. I want to articulate _what_ flipping looks like for me in more concrete terms when I&#8217;m asked. I want to see what other people do. I want to be challenged.

I&#8217;m really looking forward to the next eight weeks.
