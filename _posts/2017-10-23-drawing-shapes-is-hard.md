My wife is putting together a simple gift for our niece. Lest I spoil a surprise, I&#8217;ll be vague about the specifics. It required some hexagons. We started, logically, with an octagon.

I approached this mathematically. Find the midpoint on one edge, work an equal distance out either side, then connect the dots. Bam.

Wait&#8230;that didn&#8217;t work.

So, I moved to a circle that represented the diameter of the octagon pieces. Well, a circle was hard because I didn&#8217;t have a protractor to get the angles right. So, I moved to a rectangle with some right triangles taken out.

Well, with no protractor, it&#8217;s hard to draw a 120 degree angle. I could do a mean 45 with the quilting square, though.

Admitting defeat, I jumped to the Google and found a number of posts by searching, &#8220;draw regular hexagon.&#8221; The image searches were promising: one [linked to a post from New Mexico State University](http://sierra.nmsu.edu/morandi/CourseMaterials/RulerAndCompass.html) which described how to draw a regular hexagon using a circle and a compass.

I went out to the garage and found a compass my grandfather probably had since before I was born that I snagged while cleaning out mom and dad&#8217;s garage last year. It sat contentedly in _our_ garage until called upon, after which it performed wonderfully.

This provided me a quick reminder on the mental dissonance between thinking I know how something _should_ work and being able to describe how it _actually_ works. The best thing is that the number of points on the circle is infinite, as long as the radius is known. The more points I draw, the closer I get to another circle. This blew my mind in _[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland)_, (apparently, there&#8217;s now a [movie](http://www.flatlandthemovie.com/)?) and it blew my mind again when I did Saturday afternoon.

We&#8217;re on our way to one sweet gift (all planned and executed by my talented wife).
