I was in Centralia, IL all day today (5/22), which is about 5 hours from where I live. Somewhere in between hour 1 and boredtodeathville, I was trying to think up _something_ I could do for [ds106](http://www.ds106.us) while I was driving. My mind flashed back to an [assignment](http://assignments.ds106.us/assignments/10-step-photo-challenge/) in which you take a photo every step for 10 steps, and then create a collage.

I&#8217;ve wanted to do that one following those rules in my back yard, but it seemed like a good place to start. So, I decided to take a photo every mile for 20 miles. What I got is shown below (click the thumbnail for the full-size image to see details, all 4000px worth).

<div id="attachment_2125" style="max-width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The hardest part for me was convincing myself to only take _one picture_. I wanted to maintain the heart of grabbing a raw image and then sharing the flow of time, space, and imagery. And that included the blurry photo. I had to almost tell myself out loud not to take a &#8220;better&#8221; picture.

I have another plan for this image series, but that will have to come another time.

As always, the GIMP .xcf file is available for remixes.
