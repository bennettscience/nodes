If you&#8217;ve used [Endnote Generator](https://dev.ohheybrian.com/endnotes/) in your Docs, thanks.

I posted an update this evening which will retain the formatting of your footnotes. So, if you have text formatting (bold, underline, etc) or links, those are still there when the Endnotes are added.

You can grab the Addon from the [Docs Addon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/endnote-generator/nmhebcalinkmgflgcfapknjhbliebooc) menu. You can also take a look at the source (or contribute!) and test it out on a single document [on GitHub](https://github.com/bennettscience/endnotes).
