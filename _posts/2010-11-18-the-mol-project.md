I started teaching the concept of the mol (not the animal&#8230;the amount) in chemistry this week.  The problem is, the mol is such an impossibly large number to comprehend (6.02 x 10^23, or 602 sextillion, or 602 followed by 21 zeros) students often don&#8217;t grasp the quantity of things we are attempting to count.  So, I had them do a quick project on quantifying the number of things&#8230;anything&#8230;in a mol.  They had to relate one mol of an object to a concrete idea for people to visualize.  Many students just looked at the length of an object like a pen or a keyboard key.  Some others measured area, and still others measured volume.

For the project, they gave an example of a dozen, a gross (a dozen dozens), one million and one billion.  I got some great projects from this&#8230;better than I anticipated when I assigned it.  Below are some of the projects I had students turn in for the assignment.
