I just finished my fifth year teaching after an 18 month hiatus. I usually jot this stuff down in a notebook, but it&#8217;s full, and I haven&#8217;t replaced it yet.

### Things to remember

  * Wanting students to develop organizational skills requires me setting up a framework with which they can learn those skills.
  * Even if you use standards-based grading, it&#8217;s okay to grade other things.
  * Without a pre-defined role for technology, it will be come a barrier.
  * Without a feeling of culture, the class will never function as a whole.

This will probably be updated once my brain slows down.
