As my website and work has grown, I&#8217;ve tried to organize my resources and files a little bit better. There were some in my blog, on the main page, and on my Learn page. So, here&#8217;s a quick breakdown of what&#8217;s going on:

**[ohheybrian.com](http://www.ohheybrian.com)**
  
This is the landing page and will house all of my professional files. If you want to know about me, my philosophy, see resumes, or read summaries of work and presentations, this is the place to go. You can also find contact information for me if you would like to track me down for something.

**[the Blog](http://blog.ohheybrian.com)**
  
If you like to read ramblings, thoughts, opinions, or the occasional epiphany, you want to check out the blog. I&#8217;ll post links to interesting stories, my thoughts on class/curriculum/education-at-large, or even see some occasional student work. Probably the least formal of my pages, but maybe the most transparent.

**Global Learning**
  
Finally, this is where many of my files, presentations, and resources (both student and teacher) resources will end up. We are all learners and we live in a global learning community, and I&#8217;m trying to promote that throughout my curriculum. For presentations, I&#8217;ll usually link the presentation file for reference _only_. If you need the actual file, we&#8217;ll need to do some talking. For resources, you will be able to find those and use them however you want. This site is probably the most layered with sections for teachers and students, both organized independently.

Thanks to everyone for all the support I&#8217;ve gotten though the spring. I&#8217;m excited that the flipped classroom is gaining some attention in education and I&#8217;m going to continue to work hard to work with teachers and students on building a culture of active and productive learning.
