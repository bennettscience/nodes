# DocuTube for Google Docs

DocuTube is a utility addon which finds YouTube links in the document and adds them to a popup window right in the doc when run.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">
  <a style="color:blue !important;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/docutube/ejgghfpikoafgmcmlplhenanbeoljlpj">Try the addon now</a>
</h3>

Google Docs do not allow you to embed videos. Rather than jumping in and out of your document each time you click a video link, DocuTube automatically creates an embedded YouTube video in a popup using the links already in the document.

It reads any type of YouTube link including links in images.

**Note that Google Drawings are not supported at this point due to limitations in Google&#8217;s code.**

## Demo

## Problems?

If you run into strange errors or weird issues, leave a comment on this page. I&#8217;ve tested as much as I can on a variety of documents, but something is sure to slip through. I&#8217;ll reply here with fixes, so be sure to subscribe.
