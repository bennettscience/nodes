# Doc Emailer for Google Docs

Doc Emailer allows you to write an email draft together and send it right from Google Docs.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">
  <a style="color:blue !important;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dmail/gfnfobkfkbjlhlpmgplocoicgbphdmph">Try the AddOn now</a>
</h3>

Writing important emails is better done together. Stop trying to copy and paste everything from a Google Doc into your compose window. Format the document how you&#8217;d like (you can even include pictures!) and then send it from the AddOn.

Doc Emailer sends two versions of the email: one with formatting and images for smartphones and computer-based email clients, and one lite version (text only) for older or slower connections.

The AddOn uses your Google Contacts directory to auto-complete an email address in the address boxes. Add as many recipients as you&#8217;d like and it will send an email to everyone.

## Demo

## Problems?

If you run into strange errors or weird issues, leave a comment on this page. I&#8217;ve tested as much as I can on a variety of documents, but something is sure to slip through. I&#8217;ll reply here with fixes, so be sure to subscribe to follow up comments.
